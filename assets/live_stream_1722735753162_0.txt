[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.800]   This is a historic day ladies and gentlemen incredible things happening there storming
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.120]   DC patriots are rushing and surrounding the capitol. They're tearing down barriers. Police
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:39.360]   are struggling to maintain the crowd. Mace and punches being thrown back and forth. Two house
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.400]   buildings have been evacuated. The house cannon building and the house madison building have both
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.600]   been issued evacuation orders. Pence has said he cannot reject electoral votes outright but the
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.000]   congress themselves are objecting right now to the Arizona votes. We've all said we want to be
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.040]   peaceful like the left that shoots cops and burns down apartment buildings and fire departments and
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.120]   police stations and things and run around terrorizing America that's the left that's
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:17.840]   antifa that's BLM but Americans are mad. From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.760]   Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the Alex Jones show. I'm Harrison Smith. It's January 6th and
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.560]   Donald Trump has just begun speaking to the stop the steel march in Washington.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:45.200]   Without any further ado we go now to the president of the United States in Washington.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:52.560]   You won't show the magnitude of this crowd. Even when I turned on today I looked and I saw
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.960]   thousands of people here but you don't see hundreds of thousands of people behind you
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.720]   because they don't want to show that. We have hundreds of thousands of people here and I just
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.720]   want them to be recognized by the fake news media. Turn your cameras please and show what's really
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.520]   happening out here because these people are not going to take it any longer. They're not going
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.760]   to take it any longer. Go ahead turn your cameras please would you show they came from all over the
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:30.480]   world actually but they came from all over our country. I just really want to see what they do.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:38.560]   I just want to see how they cover it. I've never seen anything like it but it would be really great
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.120]   if we could be covered fairly by the media. The media is the biggest problem we have as far as
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.360]   I'm concerned. Single biggest problem. The fake news and the big tech. Big tech is now coming into
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.200]   their own. We beat them four years ago. We surprised them. We took them by surprise and this year
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.160]   they rigged an election. They rigged it like they've never rigged an election before and by
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:08.160]   the way last night they didn't do a bad job either if you notice. I'm honest and I just again I want
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.680]   to thank you. It's just a great honor to have this kind of crowd and to be before you and hundreds of
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.920]   thousands of American patriots who are committed to the honesty of our elections and the integrity
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.280]   of our glorious republic. All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.080]   by emboldened radical left democrats which is what they're doing and stolen by the fake news media.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.440]   That's what they've done and what they're doing. We will never give up. We will never concede.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.360]   It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:54.160]   Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore and that's what this is all about.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:06.000]   And to use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with we will stop the steal.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.440]   Today I will lay out just some of the evidence proving that we won this election
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.840]   and we won it by a landslide. This was not a close election. You know I say sometimes jokingly but
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.280]   there's no joke about it. I've been in two elections. I won them both and the second one
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:34.480]   I won much bigger than the first okay. Almost 75 million people voted for our campaign the most of
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:43.040]   any incumbent president by far in the history of our country 12 million more people than four years
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:52.400]   ago. And I was told by the real pollsters we do have real pollsters they know that we were going
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:59.200]   to do well and we were going to win. But I was told if I went from 63 million which we had four
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:08.080]   years ago to 66 million there was no chance of losing. Well we didn't go to 66 we went to 75
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:16.480]   million and they say we lost we didn't lose. And by the way does anybody believe that Joe
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:25.600]   had 80 million votes? Does anybody believe that? He had 80 million computer votes.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.760]   It's a disgrace. There's never been anything like that. You could take third world countries just
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.640]   take a look take third world countries their elections are more honest than what we've been
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:43.040]   going through in this country. It's a disgrace. It's a disgrace. Even when you look at last night
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.760]   President Donald Trump live addressing the incredible crowds out in front of the White
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.200]   House we'll be back in 60 seconds to continue this live broadcast. Infowars.com band.video
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.320]   share this link folks we'll be right back. Welcome back folks it's the Alex Jones show
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:05.200]   I'm Harrison Smith we are watching live President Trump address the multitudes gathered in Washington
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.640]   D.C. for the stop the steel march without any further ado the President of the United States.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:18.240]   Because if Mike Pence does the right thing we win the election all he has to do all and this is
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:26.000]   this is from the number one or certainly one of the top constitutional lawyers in our country
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.880]   he has the absolute right to do it we're supposed to protect our country support our country support
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:42.000]   our constitution and protect our constitution states want to revote the states got defrauded
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.240]   they were given false information they voted on it now they want to recertify they want it back
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:55.200]   all Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:08.720]   and we become president and you are the happiest people and I actually I just spoke to Mike I said
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:16.080]   Mike that doesn't take courage what takes courage is to do nothing that takes courage and then we're
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:22.160]   stuck with a president who lost the election by a lot and we have to live with that for four more
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.920]   years we're just not going to let that happen many of you have traveled from all across the
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.040]   nation to be here and I want to thank you for the extraordinary love that's what it is there's never
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:39.600]   been a movement like this ever ever for the extraordinary love for this amazing country
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:54.080]   and this amazing movement thank you
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:02.720]   by the way this goes all the way back past the Washington monument you believe this look at this
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:09.920]   that is unfortunately gay they gave the press the prime seats I can't stand that
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:16.480]   now but you look at that behind I wish they'd flip those cameras and look behind you that is
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:24.320]   the most amazing sight when they make a mistake you get to see it on television amazing amazing
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:33.360]   all the way back and don't worry we will not take the name off the Washington monument we will
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:41.040]   cancel culture you know they wanted to get rid of the Jefferson memorial either take it down
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.760]   or just put somebody else in there I don't think that's going to happen it damn well better not
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:51.520]   although with this administration if this happens it could happen you'll see some really bad things
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.560]   happen they'll knock out Lincoln too by the way they've been taking his statue down but then we
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:02.800]   signed a little law you hurt our monuments you hurt our heroes you go to jail for 10 years and
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:10.800]   everything stopped you notice that it stopped it all stopped and they could use Rudy back in New
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:17.760]   York City Rudy they could use you your city's going to hell they want Rudy Giuliani back in
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:24.880]   New York we'll get a little younger version of Rudy is that okay Rudy we're gathered together
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:33.760]   in the heart of our nation's capital for one very very basic and simple reason to save our democracy
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:42.880]   you know most candidates on election evening and of course this thing goes on so long they still
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.520]   don't have any idea what the votes are we still have congressional seats under review they have
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:53.920]   no idea they've totally lost control they've used the pandemic as a way of defrauding the people
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:10:00.960]   in a proper election but you know you know when you see this and when you see what's happening
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:06.160]   number one they also sir we'll never let it happen again i said that's good but what about
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:12.160]   eight weeks ago you know they try and get you to go they say sir in four years you're guaranteed
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.200]   i said i'm not interested right now do me a favor go back eight weeks i want to go back eight weeks
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:24.240]   let's go back eight weeks we want to go back and we want to get this right because we're going to
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.600]   have somebody in there that should not be in there and our country will be destroyed and we're not
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:37.600]   going to stand for that for years democrats have gotten away with election fraud and weak
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:43.280]   republicans and that's what they are there's so many weak republicans and we have great ones
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.440]   jim jordan and some of these guys they're out there fighting the house guys are fighting
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.880]   but it's uh it's incredible many of the republicans i helped them get in i helped them
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:58.240]   get elected i helped mitch get elected i helped i could name
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:06.960]   24 of them let's say i won't bore you with it and then all of a sudden you have something like this
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:13.760]   and it's like oh uh gee maybe i'll talk to the president sometime later no it's amazing the weak
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.240]   republicans they're pathetic republicans and that's what happens if this happened to the
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:24.640]   democrats there'd be hell all over the country going on there'd be hell all over the country
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:31.440]   but just remember this you're stronger you're smarter you've got more going than anybody
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:36.960]   and they try and demean everybody having to do with us and you're the real people you're the
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.600]   people that built this nation you're not the people that tore down our nation
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:48.320]   the weak republicans and that's it i really believe it i think i'm going to use the term
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.000]   the weak republicans you got a lot of them and you got a lot of great ones but you got a lot of
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.400]   weak ones they've turned a blind eye even as democrats enacted policies that shipped away our
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:06.880]   jobs weakened our military threw open our borders and put america last did you see the other day
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:12.320]   where joe biden said i want to get rid of the america first policy what's that all about get

[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:24.800]   about it right unbelievable what we have to go through what we have to go through and you have
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:30.160]   to get your people to fight and if they don't fight we have to primary the hell out of the
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:35.120]   ones that don't fight you primary them we're gonna we're gonna let you know who they are
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:42.720]   i could already tell you frankly but this year using the pretext of the china virus and the scam
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:49.920]   of mail-in ballots democrats attempted the most brazen and outrageous election theft and there's
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:55.280]   never been anything like this it's a pure theft in american history everybody knows it that
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:02.080]   election our election was over at 10 o'clock in the evening we're leading pennsylvania michigan

[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:46.560]   flight in last night but when romney got beaten you know he stands up like you're more typical

[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:05.120]   was okay maybe it was that's what happened but we look at the facts and our election was so corrupt
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.840]   that in the history of this country we've never seen anything like it you can go all the way back
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:15.520]   you know america is blessed with elections all over the world they talk about our elections you
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:20.400]   know what the world says about us now they say we don't have free and fair elections and you know
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:28.400]   what else we don't have a free and fair press our media is not free it's not fair it suppresses
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:36.480]   thought it suppresses speech and it's become the enemy of the people it's become the enemy of the
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:43.040]   people it's a it's the biggest problem we have in this country no third world countries would even
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:50.400]   attempt to do what we caught them doing and you'll hear about that in just a few minutes republicans
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:15:00.480]   are republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back it's
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:10.160]   like a boxer and we want to be so nice we want to be so respectful of everybody including bad people
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:16.960]   and we're going to have to fight much harder and mike pence is going to have to come through for us
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:26.560]   and if he doesn't that will be a sad day for our country because you're sworn to uphold our
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:36.320]   constitution now it is up to congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy donald
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:41.680]   trump giving it to republicans and democrats alike in defense of the constitution we have to go to a
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:46.560]   quick commercial break it's the alex jones show we'll be right back with more of donald trump live
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:52.320]   from outside the white house when we get back stay with us folks we are live folks it's the
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.640]   alex jones show i'm harrison smith we're watching president trump address the multitudes out in front
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:02.000]   of the white house alex jones will soon be leading a parade to the capital but for now we go back to
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.520]   the president of the united states who's laying out the evidence of the vote fraud we set a record
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:13.600]   and we set a record with hispanic with the black community we set a record with everybody
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:23.600]   today we see a very important event though because right over there right there we see the event
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:30.240]   going to take place and i'm going to be watching because history is going to be made we're going
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:36.480]   to see whether or not we have great and courageous leaders or whether or not we have leaders that
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:43.120]   should be ashamed of themselves throughout history throughout eternity they'll be ashamed
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:49.760]   and you know what if they do the wrong thing we should never ever forget that they did
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:56.880]   never forget we should never ever forget with only three of the seven states in question
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:04.560]   we win the presidency of the united states and by the way it's much more important today
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:12.560]   than it was 24 hours ago because and don't i spoke to david perdue what a great person
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:20.320]   and kelly leffler two great people but it was a setup and you know i said we have no
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:28.240]   back line anymore the only back line the only line of demarcation the only line that we have
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:34.640]   is the veto of the president of the united states so this is now what we're doing a far more
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:42.880]   important election than it was two days ago i want to thank the more than 140 members of the house
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:49.280]   those are warriors they're over there working like you've never seen before studying talking
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:56.000]   actually going all the way back studying the roots of the constitution because they know we have the
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:03.680]   right to send a bad vote that was illegally gotten they gave these people bad things to vote for and
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.000]   they voted because what did they know and then when they found out a few weeks later again it
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.840]   took them four years to devise this screen and the only unhappy person in the united states single
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:19.680]   most unhappy is hillary clinton because she said why didn't you do this for me four years ago
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:26.480]   why didn't you do this for me four years ago change the votes ten thousand in michigan
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.760]   you could have changed the whole thing but uh she's not too happy you notice she
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.360]   you don't see her anymore what happened where's hillary where is she
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:43.440]   but i want to thank all of those congressmen and women i also want to thank our 13
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:51.920]   most courageous members of the u.s senate senator ted cruz senator ron johnson senator josh holly
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:19:00.800]   kelly lafleur and kelly lafleur i'll tell you she has been she's been so great she works so hard
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:06.880]   so let's give her and david a little special head because it was rigged against them let's give her
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:16.080]   and david kelly lafleur david perdue they fought a good race they never had a shot that equipment
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.960]   should never have been allowed to be used and i was telling these people don't let them use this
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:30.480]   stuff marcia blackburn terrific person mike brawn indiana steve danes great guy bill hagarty john
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:38.720]   kennedy james lankford cinthia lumps tommy tubberville to the coach and roger marshall
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.760]   we want to thank them senators have stepped up we want to thank them
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:49.840]   i actually think though it takes again more courage not to step up and i think a lot of
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.840]   those people are going to find that out and you better start looking at your leadership because
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:59.840]   your leadership has led you down the tubes you know we don't want to give two thousand dollars
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:04.320]   to people we want to give them six hundred dollars oh great how does that play politically pretty
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:12.480]   good and this has nothing to do with politics but how does it play politically china destroyed these
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:18.800]   people we didn't disturb china destroyed them totally destroyed them we want to give them six
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:25.440]   hundred dollars and they just wouldn't change i said give them two thousand dollars we'll pay it
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:32.720]   back we'll pay it back fast you already owe 26 trillion give them a couple of bucks let them live
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:41.280]   give them a couple of bucks and some of the people here disagree with me on that but i i just say
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:45.760]   look you got to let people live and how does that play though okay number one it's the right thing
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:51.920]   to do but how does that play politically i think it's the primary reason one of the primary reasons
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.760]   the other was just pure cheating that was the primary super primary reason
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:01.440]   but you can't do that you got to use your head as you know the media has constantly asserted the
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:06.240]   outrageous lie that there was no evidence of widespread fraud you ever see these people
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:12.080]   while there is no evidence of fraud or really well i'm going to read you pages i hope you don't get
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:17.280]   bored listening to it promise don't get bored listening to it all those hundreds of thousands
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:25.120]   of people back there move them up please yeah all they all these people don't get bored don't get
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:30.720]   angry at me because you're going to get bored because it's so much the american people do not
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:38.320]   believe the corrupt fake news anymore they have ruined their reputation but you know it used to
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.720]   be that they'd argue with me i'd fight so i'd fight that fight i'd fight that fight bump up
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:47.120]   you'd believe me you'd believe them somebody comes out you know they had their point of view i had
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:52.880]   my point of view but you'd have an argument now what they do is they go silent it's called
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:59.760]   suppression and that's what happens in a communist country that's what they do they suppress you
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:04.080]   don't fight with them anymore unless it's a bad serve they have a little bad story about me they
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:09.120]   make it 10 times worse than it's a major headline but hunter biden they don't talk about him what
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:15.520]   happened to hunter where's hunter where's hunter they don't talk about him now watch all the sets
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:21.040]   will go off well they can't do that because they get good ratings yeah the ratings are too good
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:28.720]   now where's hunter you know and and how come joe was allowed to give a billion dollars of money
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:33.600]   to get rid of the prosecutor in ukraine how does that happen i'd ask you that question
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:39.920]   how does that happen can you imagine if i said that if i said that it would be a whole different
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:47.520]   ball game and how come hunter gets three and a half million dollars from the mayor of moscow's
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:54.320]   wife and gets hundreds of thousands of dollars to sit on an energy board even though he admits he
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:23:01.840]   has no knowledge of energy and millions of dollars up front and how come they go into china and they
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:07.200]   leave with billions of dollars to manage have you managed money before no i haven't oh that's good
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:13.200]   here's about three billion no they don't talk about that no we have a corrupt media they've
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:20.160]   gone silent they've gone dead i now realize how good it was if you go back 10 years i realize
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:27.200]   how good even though i didn't necessarily love them i realized how good it was like a cleansing
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:34.720]   motion right but we don't have that anymore we don't have a fair media anymore it's suppression
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.600]   and you have to be very careful with that and they've lost all credibility in this country
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:48.160]   we will not be intimidated into accepting the hoaxes and the lies that we've been forced to
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:56.160]   believe over the past several weeks we've amassed overwhelming evidence about a fake election this
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:01.440]   is the presidential election last night was a little bit better because of the fact that we
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:07.440]   had a lot of eyes watching one specific state but they cheated like hell anyway you have one of the
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:13.520]   dumbest governors in the united states and you know when i this is the president of the united
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:19.120]   states donald trump giving perhaps the most important speech of his entire presidency and
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:24.720]   perhaps will change the course of history he plans on laying out in detail the evidence of voter
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:29.920]   fraud we'll bring it all to you live on infowars.com and band.video on the other side folks don't go
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:36.560]   anywhere just 11 days prior to the election so think of what they did no longer is their
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:43.200]   signature verification oh that's okay we want voter id by the way but no longer is their
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:49.040]   signature verification 11 days before the election they say we don't want it you know why they don't
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:54.320]   want to because they want to cheat that's the only reason who would even think of that we don't want
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:25:03.520]   to verify a signature there were over 205 000 more ballots counted in pennsylvania now think of this
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:13.680]   you had 205 000 more ballots than you had voters that means you had 200 where did they come from
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:20.160]   you know where they came from somebody's imagination whatever they needed so in pennsylvania you had
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:28.240]   205 000 more votes than you had voters and it's the number is actually much greater than that now
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:36.160]   that was as of a week ago and this is a mathematical impossibility unless you want to
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:43.760]   say it's a total fraud so pennsylvania was defrauded over 8 000 ballots in pennsylvania
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:52.160]   were cast by people whose names and dates of birth match individuals who died in 2020 and prior
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:59.680]   to the election think of that dead people lots of dead people thousands and some dead people
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:05.280]   actually requested an application that bothers me even not only are they voting they want an
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:13.280]   application to vote one of them was 29 years ago died it's incredible over 14 000 ballots were cast
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.840]   by out of state voters so these are voters that don't live in the state
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:26.560]   and by the way these numbers are what they call outcome determinative meaning these numbers far
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:33.440]   surpassed i lost by a very little bit these numbers are massive massive more than 10 000 votes
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:41.760]   in pennsylvania were illegally counted even though they were received after election day in other
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:48.800]   words they were received after election day let's count them anyway and what they did in many cases
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:55.040]   is they did fraud they took the date and they moved it back so that it no longer is after
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:27:03.040]   election day and more than 60 000 ballots in pennsylvania were reported received back they
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:08.480]   got back before they were ever supposedly mailed out in other words you got the ballot back before
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:18.800]   you mailed it which is also logically and logistically impossible right think of that one
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:24.480]   you got the ballot back let's send the ballots so they've already been sent but we got the ballot
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:30.240]   back before they were sent i don't think that's too good right 25 000 ballots in pennsylvania
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:37.680]   were requested by nursing home residents all in a single giant batch not legal indicating an
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:42.800]   enormous illegal ballot harvesting operation you're not allowed to do it's against the law
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:48.400]   the day before the election the state of pennsylvania reported the number of absentee ballots
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:57.440]   that had been sent out yet this number was suddenly and drastically increased by 400 000
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:05.920]   people it was increased nobody knows where it came from by 400 000 ballots one day after the election
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:12.800]   it remains totally unexplained they said well we can't uh figure that now that's many many
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:19.360]   times what it would take to overthrow the state just that one element 400 000 ballots appeared
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:25.520]   from nowhere right after the election by the way pennsylvania has now seen all of this they
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:30.960]   didn't know because it was so quick they had a vote they voted but now they see all this stuff
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:38.000]   it's all come to life it doesn't happen that fast and they want to recertify their votes
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.160]   they want to recertify but the only way that can happen is if mike pence agrees to send it back
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:50.480]   mike pence has to agree to send it
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:29:03.120]   back
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:07.280]   and many people in congress want to send back and think of what you're doing
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:11.200]   let's say you don't do it somebody says well we have to obey the constitution and you are
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:16.640]   because you're protecting our country and you're protecting the constitution so you are
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:21.840]   but think of what happens let's say they're stiffs and they're stupid people and they say
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:26.480]   well we really have no choice even though pennsylvania and other states want to redo
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:33.520]   their votes they want to see the numbers they already have the numbers go very quickly and they
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:38.480]   want to redo their legislature because many of these votes were taken as i said because it wasn't
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:43.600]   approved by their legislature you know that in itself is legal and then you have the scam and
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:49.040]   that's all of the things that we're talking about but think of this if you don't do that that means
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:56.000]   you will have a president of the united states for four years with his wonderful son you will have
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:04.720]   a president who lost all of these states or you will have a president to put it another way who
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:13.680]   was voted on by a bunch of stupid people who lost all of these states you will have an illegitimate
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:20.240]   president that's what you'll have and we can't let that happen these are the facts that you won't
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:25.680]   hear from the fake news media it's all part of the suppression effort they don't want to talk about
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:30.560]   it they don't want to talk about it in fact when i started talking about that i guarantee you a lot
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:35.600]   of the television sets and a lot of those cameras went off and that's a lot of cameras back there
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:42.480]   but a lot of them went off but these are the things you don't hear about you don't hear though
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:47.280]   what you just heard i'm going to go over a few more states but you don't hear it by the people
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:53.760]   who want to deceive you and demoralize you and control you big tech media just like the
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:31:01.440]   suppression polls that said we're going to lose wisconsin by 17 points well we won wisconsin they
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:06.800]   don't have it that way because it was just by a little sliver but they had me down the day before
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:14.560]   washington post abc poll down 17 points i called up a real pollster i said what is that sir that's
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:19.920]   called a suppression poll i think you're going to win wisconsin sir i said but why don't they make it
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:25.600]   four or five points because then people vote but when you're down 17 they say hey i'm not going to
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:33.120]   waste my time i love the president but there's no way despite that despite that we won wisconsin
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:40.080]   it's going to see i mean you'll see but that's called suppression because a lot of people when
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:45.520]   they see that it's very interesting this pollster said sir if you're down three four five people
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:50.880]   vote when you go down 17 they say let's save let's go and have dinner and let's watch the
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:57.200]   presidential defeat tonight on television darling and just like the radical left tries to blacklist
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:03.840]   you on social media every time i put out a tweet that's even if it's totally correct totally
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:11.200]   correct i get a flag i get a flag and they also don't let you get out you know on twitter it's
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:17.280]   very hard to come onto my account it's very hard to get out of message they don't let the message
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:22.960]   get out nearly like they should but i've had many people say i can't get on your twitter i don't
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:28.400]   care about twitter twitter's bad news they're all bad news but you know what if you wanna if you
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:34.320]   want to get out a message and if you want to go through big tech social media they are really if
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:39.200]   you're a conservative if you're a republican if you have a big voice i guess they call it shadow
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:45.760]   ban right shadow ban they shadow ban you and it should be illegal i've been telling these
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:54.720]   republicans get rid of section 230 and for some reason mitch and the group they don't want to
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:33:01.520]   put it in there and they don't realize that that's going to be the end of the republican party as we
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:08.160]   know it but it's never going to be the end of us never let them get out let let the weak ones get
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:15.680]   out this is a time for strength they also want to indoctrinate your children in school by teaching
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:21.760]   them things that aren't so they want to indoctrinate your children it's all part of the
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:29.040]   comprehensive assault on our democracy and the american people are finally standing up and saying
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:36.000]   no this crowd is again a testament to it i did no advertising i did nothing you do have some groups
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.280]   that are big supporters i want to thank that amy and everybody we have some incredible supporters
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.920]   incredible but we didn't do anything we have pre-programmed commercial breaks but we'll keep
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:50.320]   our uh interjections to an absolute minimum we'll be right back in just a minute or so
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:54.240]   to hear more from the president of the united states live in front of the white house
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:59.360]   addressing the save america march welcome back folks we go live directly to donald trump
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:04.720]   president of the united states addressing his supporters in washington dc of signatures in
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:12.240]   fulton county they won't let us do it the only reason they won't is because we'll find things
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:18.640]   in the hundreds of thousands why wouldn't they let us verify signatures in fulton county
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:24.640]   which is known for being very corrupt they won't do it they go to some other county where you would
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:31.840]   live i said that's not the problem the problem is fulton county home of stacy abram she did a
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:37.200]   good job i congratulate her but it was done in such a way that we can't let this stuff happen
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:43.840]   we won't have a country if it happens as a result georgia's absentee ballot rejection rate was more
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:53.920]   than 10 times lower than previous levels because the criteria was so off 48 counties in georgia
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:35:02.480]   with thousands and thousands of votes rejected zero ballots it wasn't one ballot in other words
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:08.000]   in a year in which more mail-in ballots were sent than ever before and more people were voting by
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.240]   mail for the first time the rejection rate was drastically lower than it had ever been before
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:22.160]   the only way this can be explained is if tens of thousands of illegitimate votes were added to the
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:26.800]   tally that's the only way you could explain it by the way you're talking about tens of thousands
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:34.400]   if georgia had merely rejected the same number of unlawful ballots as in other years there should
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:41.440]   have been approximately 45 000 ballots rejected far more than what we needed to win just over
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:49.520]   11 000 they should find those votes they should absolutely find that just over 11 000 votes that's
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:55.200]   all we need they defrauded us out of a win in georgia and we're not going to forget it
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:01.120]   there's only one reason the democrats could possibly want to eliminate signature matching
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:08.080]   oppose voter id and stop citizenship confirmation are you a citizenship you're not allowed to ask
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:14.960]   that question because they want to steal the election the radical left knows exactly what
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:22.000]   they're doing they're ruthless and it's time that somebody did something about it and mike pence i
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:29.040]   hope you're going to stand up for the good of our constitution and for the good of our country and
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:35.440]   if you're not i'm going to be very disappointed in you i will tell you right now i'm not hearing
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:42.400]   good stories in fulton county republican poll watchers were ejected in some cases physically
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:49.760]   from the room under the false pretense of a pipe burst water main burst everybody leave which we
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:58.640]   now know was a total lie then election officials pull boxes democrats and suitcases of ballots out
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:04.560]   from under a table you all saw it on television totally fraudulent and illegally scanned them
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:11.840]   for nearly two hours totally unsupervised tens of thousands of votes this act coincided with
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:21.520]   a mysterious vote dump of up to 100 000 votes for joe biden almost none for trump oh that sounds fair
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:29.600]   that was at 1 34 a.m the georgia secretary of state and pathetic governor of georgia
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:33.840]   average although he says i'm a great president you know i sort of maybe have to change he said
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:38.960]   the other day yes i do i disagree with president but he's been a great president oh good thanks
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:45.760]   thank you very much because of him and others yeah brian kemp vote him the hell out of office please
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:53.360]   well his rates are so low you know his approval rating now i think it just reads a record low
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:38:00.160]   they've rejected five separate appeals for an independent and comprehensive audit of signatures
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:06.320]   in fulton county even without an audit the number of fraudulent ballots that we've identified across
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:14.080]   the state is staggering over 10 300 ballots in georgia were cast by individuals whose names and
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:22.560]   dates of birth match georgia residents who died in 2020 and prior to the election more than 2 500
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:29.920]   ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match incarcerated felons in georgia
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:37.440]   prison people who are not allowed to vote more than 4 500 illegal ballots were cast by individuals
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:44.560]   who do not appear on the state's own voter rolls over 18 000 illegal ballots were cast by
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:51.680]   individuals who registered to vote using an address listed as vacant according to the postal service
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:39:00.560]   at least 88 000 ballots in georgia were cast by people whose registrations were illegally
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:09.200]   backdated 66 000 votes each one of these is far more than we need 66 000 votes in georgia were
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:16.320]   cast by individuals under the legal voting age and at least 15 000 ballots were cast by individuals
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:22.080]   who moved out of the state prior to november 3rd election they say they moved right back they move
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:26.400]   right back oh they moved out they move right back okay they miss georgia's that that much i do i
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:36.560]   love georgia but it's a corrupt system despite all of this the margin in georgia is only 11 779 votes
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:45.920]   each and every one of these issues is enough to give us a victory in georgia a big beautiful
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:52.560]   victory make no mistake this election was stolen from you from me and from the country and not a
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:59.120]   single swing state has conducted a comprehensive audit to remove the illegal ballots this should
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:05.520]   absolutely occur in every single contested state before the election is certified in the state of
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:14.000]   arizona over 36 000 ballots were illegally cast by non-citizens 2 000 ballots were returned with
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:21.280]   no address more than 22 000 ballots were returned before they were ever supposedly mailed out they
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:29.040]   returned but we haven't mailed them yet 11 600 more ballots and votes were counted more than
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:36.400]   there were actual voters you see that so you have more votes again than you have voters 150 000
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:45.600]   people registered in maya copa county after the registration deadline 103 000 ballots in the county
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:51.920]   were sent for electronic adjudication with no republican observers in clark county nevada the
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:58.080]   accuracy settings on signature verification machines were purposely lowered before they
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:05.760]   were used to count over 130 000 ballots if you signed your name as santa clause
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:16.560]   it would go through there were also more than 42 000 double votes in nevada over 150 000 people
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:24.720]   were hurt so badly by what took place and 1500 ballots were cast by individuals whose
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:32.160]   names and dates of birth match nevada residents who died in 2020 prior to november 3rd election
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:38.400]   more than 8 000 votes were cast by individuals who had no address and probably didn't live there
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:44.960]   the margin in nevada is down at a very low number any of these things would have taken
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:51.120]   care of the situation we would have won nevada also every one of these were going over we win
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:58.080]   in michigan quickly the secretary of state a real great one flooded the state with unsolicited mail
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:04.880]   in ballot application sent to every person on the rolls in direct violation of state law more than
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:11.760]   17 000 michigan ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match people who
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:20.880]   were deceased in wayne county that's a great one that's detroit 174 000 ballots were counted without
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:27.040]   being tied to an actual registered voter nobody knows where they came from also in wayne county
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:34.480]   poll watch is observed canvassers re-scanning batches of ballots over and over again up to
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:43.280]   three or four or five times in detroit turnout was 139 of registered voters think of that
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:52.640]   so you had 139 of the people in detroit voting this is in michigan detroit michigan a career
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:59.920]   employee of the detroit city of detroit testified under penalty of perjury that she witnessed city
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:07.200]   workers coaching voters to vote straight democrat while accompanying them to watch who they voted
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:14.240]   for when a republican came in they wouldn't talk to him the same worker was instructed not to ask
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:21.520]   for any voter id and not to attempt to validate any signatures if they were democrats she also
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:28.000]   told to illegally and was told backdate ballots received after the deadline and reports that
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:35.280]   thousands and thousands of ballots were improperly backdated that's michigan four witnesses have
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:41.680]   testified under penalty of perjury that after officials in detroit announced the last votes
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:49.440]   had been counted tens of thousands of additional ballots arrived without required envelopes every
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:56.240]   single one was for a democrat i got no votes at 6 31 a.m in the early morning hours after
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:07.280]   voting had ended michigan subtly reported 147 000 votes an astounding 94 went to joe biden
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:14.000]   who campaigned brilliantly from his basement only trump is laying out the numbers in black and white
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.080]   in front of the white house in washington dc we have to go to a quick commercial break it'll
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:22.400]   be one minute long and we'll be back immediately with more of the of the president's speech we'll
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:26.880]   be right back folks stay with us please welcome back folks second hour of the alex jones show
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:33.360]   has begun we go live back to donald trump in front of the white house uh laying out in stark detail
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:37.920]   the hundreds of thousands of inconsistencies that have yet to been addressed by the mainstream media
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:46.960]   president trump going way down to 17 000 and biden going way up to 29 391 and that was very quick
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:55.840]   a 12 000 vote switch all in mr biden's favor so i mean i could go on and on about this fraud that
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:45:02.240]   took place in every state and all of these legislatures want this back i don't want to do
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:09.840]   it to you because i love you and it's freezing out here but i could just go on forever i can tell you
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:30.320]   this so when you hear when you hear while there is no evidence to prove any wrongdoing this is
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:36.880]   the most fraudulent thing anybody said this is a criminal enterprise this is a criminal enterprise
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:41.840]   and and the press will say and i'm sure they won't put any of that on there because that's no good
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:48.880]   and you ever see while there is no evidence to back president trump's assertion i could go on
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:54.880]   for another hour reading this stuff to you and telling you about it there's never been anything
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:46:03.760]   like it think about it detroit had more votes than it had voters pennsylvania had 205 000
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:09.280]   more votes than it had more but you don't have to go any that between that i think that's almost
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:14.960]   better than dead people if you think right more votes than they had voters and many other states
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:22.000]   also it's a disgrace that the united states of america tens of millions of people are allowed
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:29.360]   to go vote without so much as even showing identification in no state is there any question
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:39.440]   or effort made to verify the identity citizenship residency or eligibility of the votes cast
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:43.120]   the republicans have to get tougher you're not going to have a republican party if you don't
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:49.200]   get tougher they want to play so straight they want to play so sir yes the united states the
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:55.200]   constitution doesn't allow me to send them back to the states well i say yes it does because the
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:47:00.240]   constitution says you have to protect our country and you have to protect our constitution and you
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:06.160]   can't vote on fraud and fraud breaks up everything doesn't it when you catch somebody in a fraud
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:13.680]   you're allowed to go by very different rules so i hope mike has the courage to do what he has to do
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:19.040]   and i hope he doesn't listen to the rhinos and the stupid people that he's listening to
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:26.560]   it is also widely understood that the voter rolls are crammed full of non-citizens felons and people
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:33.040]   who have moved out of state and individuals who are otherwise ineligible to vote yet democrats
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:38.000]   oppose every effort to clean up their voter rolls they don't want to clean them up they're loaded
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   and how many people here know other people that when the hundreds of thousands and then
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:50.480]   millions of ballots got sent out got three four five six and i heard one who got seven ballots
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:58.880]   and then they say you didn't quite make it sir we won we won in a landslide this was a landslide
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:07.280]   they said it's not american to challenge the election this is the most corrupt election in
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:12.080]   the history maybe of the world you know you can go third world countries but i don't think they had
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:18.160]   hundreds of thousands of votes and they don't have voters for them i mean no matter where you go
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:23.360]   nobody would think this in fact it's so egregious it's so bad that a lot of people don't even believe
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:30.720]   it it's so crazy that people don't even believe it it can't be true so they don't believe it this
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:39.280]   is not just a matter of domestic politics this is a matter of national security so today in addition
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:45.280]   to challenging the certification of the election i'm calling on congress and the state legislatures
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:51.200]   to quickly pass sweeping election reforms and you better do it before we have no country left
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:55.040]   today is not the end it's just the beginning
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:49:02.640]   with your help over the last four years we built the greatest political movement in the history of
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:09.200]   our country and nobody even 60 second break and we return live from washington dc it's infowars.com
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:13.520]   this is the alex jones show we'll be right back welcome back folks it's the alex jones show my
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:17.360]   name is harrison smith donald trump is finishing up his remarks in front of the white house at the
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:24.160]   same time the joint session of the house has begun and we'll bring you both of these as they occur
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:29.200]   we'll go back to donald trump as he finishes up and then we'll uh jump over to mike pence as he
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:36.160]   leads the senate we will stop the practice of universal unsolicited mail-in balloting we will
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:41.920]   clean up the voter rolls that ensure that every single person who casts a vote is a citizen of
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:48.960]   our country a resident of the state in which they vote and their vote is cast in a lawful and honest
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:57.680]   manner we will restore the vital civic tradition of in-person voting on election day so that voters
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:05.760]   can be fully informed when they make their choice we will finally hold big tech accountable and if
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:13.360]   these people had courage and guts they would get rid of section 230 something that no other company
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:23.600]   no other person in america in the world has all of these tech monopolies are going to abuse their
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:30.640]   power and interfere in our elections and it has to be stopped and the republicans have to get a
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:36.320]   lot tougher and so should the democrats they should be regulated investigated and brought
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:42.480]   to justice under the fullest extent of the law they're totally breaking the law together we will
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:48.560]   drain the washington swamp and we will clean up the corruption in our nation's capital we have
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:54.800]   done a big job on it but you think it's easy it's a dirty business it's a dirty business you have a
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:51:01.440]   lot of bad people out there despite everything we've been through looking out all over this
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:05.680]   country and seeing fantastic crowds although this i think is our all-time record
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:16.960]   i think you have 250 000 people 250 000 looking out at all the amazing patriots here today
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:24.160]   i have never been more confident in our nation's future well i have to say we have to be a little
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:27.520]   bit careful that's a nice statement but we have to be a little careful with that statement
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:34.240]   if we allow this group of people to illegally take over our country because it's illegal when
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:41.280]   the votes are illegal when the way they got there is illegal when the states that vote are given
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:48.560]   false and fraudulent information we are the greatest country on earth and we are headed
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:53.360]   and we're headed in the right direction you know the wall is built we're doing record numbers at
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:59.200]   the wall now they want to take down the wall let's let everyone flow in let's let everybody flow in
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:06.080]   we did a great job in the wall remember the wall they said it could never be done one of the largest
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:11.200]   infrastructure projects we've ever had in this country and it's had a tremendous impact and
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:14.960]   we got rid of catch and release we got rid of all of the stuff that we had to live with
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:19.920]   but now the caravans they think biden's getting in the caravans are forming again

[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:17.680]   to let them do it this new system is a military high tech attack and we need to understand we're
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:23.680]   under attack we need to understand this is 21st century warfare and get on the war footing and not

[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:38.880]   crowd at the same time in the capitol building the word is mike pence has rejected trump's call
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:41.840]   he has failed to show the courage that donald trump was attempting
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:47.440]   to imbue in him and has begun the counting of the electoral votes
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:55.520]   at the same time there's word that thousands of patriots have broken through the barriers
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:58:00.240]   around the capital and are now moving towards it to occupy that's the word from elijah shafer who's
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:05.120]   on the ground and alex jones continues to speak to this crowd let's go back to alex jones
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:14.000]   the great reset is triggering the great awakening and the great awakening will trigger the great
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   rebellion and the destruction of the new world order
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:36.320]   we all know that our system has been corrupt for a long time the whole world knows our system has been corrupt for a long time and they've been waiting for americans to stand up
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:40.000]   and they've been waiting for a leader of america to stand up and do the right thing
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:45.920]   expose it and then bring it to its knees for its ultimate defeat and that's what we do starting
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:53.520]   now in the year 2021 this is it folks live from washington dc mike pence rejects trump's call to
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:58.560]   overturn biden election as patriots move towards the capitol building this is it folks we'll be

[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:24.480]   the objections breaking from elijah shafer patriots have stormed the capitol building
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:29.920]   ground and are breaching federal barriers and police in the masses no cell service but video
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:35.920]   coming non-lethal force in effect full unlawful assembly on display never seen anything like this
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:42.160]   insane thousands occupying and you see the video here of patriots pushing against the capitol city
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:48.560]   police as they move towards the capitol building uh estimates upwards of a million patriots right
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:53.520]   now have gathered for this and threaten to overwhelm the defenses of the capitol building
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:59.360]   from the election wizard on twitter 60 congressman have just objected to the electoral votes from
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:05.600]   arizona applause rung out in the halls of congress vice president mike pence released this statement
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:12.240]   essentially abrogating the responsibility of rejecting or accepting the electoral votes he
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:17.200]   says during the 130 years since the electoral count act was passed congress has without exception
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:21.280]   use these formal procedures to count the electoral votes every four years given the controversy
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:27.040]   surrounding this year's election some approach this year's uh quadrenal uh tradition with great
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:32.000]   expectation and others with dismissive disdain some believe as vice president i should be able
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.480]   to accept or reject electoral votes unilaterally others believe electoral votes should never be
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:40.720]   challenged in a joint session of congress after careful study of our constitution our laws our
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:45.360]   history i believe neither view is correct and essentially he says he's going to leave it up to
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:50.880]   the legislatures and he himself is not going to exert the unilateral authority to determine which
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:56.480]   electoral votes should be counted and which should not while he says quote while my uh role as
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:00.720]   presiding officer is largely ceremonial the role of the congress is much different in the electoral
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:06.240]   count of 1887 establishes a clear procedure to address elect election controversies when they
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:12.640]   arise during the count of the vote of the electoral college republicans have objected to accepting
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:18.800]   accepting arizona's electoral votes senator ted cruz and representative paul uh gosar of arizona
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:25.120]   objected to the counting of electoral votes from arizona won by joe biden so chaos abounds around
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:30.960]   the capitol building we are now getting a live feed as alex jones continues to lead the march
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:36.480]   towards the capitol building and we are receiving video updates on the ground as it looks like
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:44.000]   patriots are threatening to overwhelm the security of the capitol and break in uh let's go back to uh
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:50.880]   alex jones as he marches and we'll continue to get updates here again this is unprecedented
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:56.160]   in american history you can hear the police alarms going off
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:00.240]   chaos reigns
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:09.360]   ambulances moving towards the scene you can see there on the right is the old post office building
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:15.920]   which is now the trump hotel which has been a major gathering point for patriots ever since
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:21.360]   trump got elected they're moving now through freedom plaza you can see the just massive stream
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:30.000]   of humanity alex jones own shawyer greg reese and others falling behind as they march towards the
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.200]   capitol building which is already under siege e and miles chong these are your love tweets out
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:39.360]   there's just so many trump supporters surrounding the capital and you see this massive humanity
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:46.560]   elements of as we say estimated a million people moving to surround the capitol and shawyer and
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:54.800]   alex jones now speaking through the bullhorn to the crowds who follow them
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:13.600]   this is history happening we're not giving it to the globalist we're never surrendering
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:21.040]   this is our country this is our country not our corrupt politician's country
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:28.000]   they work for us and it's time to get a family reminder who our boss is the communist chinese
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:35.760]   and the globalist and hollywood don't run this country and our children do not belong to their
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:43.040]   pedophile prayers we will not accept the election of that child molesting joe biden
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:48.960]   that chinese communist agent joe biden we know where he belongs and it's not the white house
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:56.160]   china joe biden is a child molester baby got to go
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:04.560]   so
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:12.000]   is now uh objecting to this he's got uh the article the second article of the
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.720]   constitution up behind him uh let's go to what he says as we continue to roll b-roll
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:21.200]   of the conflicts taking place between trump supporters and police outside of
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:25.520]   the capital you see mace being sprayed punches being thrown in both directions
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:31.600]   as the uh conflict escalates this is truly incredible historic stuff folks the day has
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:37.760]   just begun the violence may get out of control but you see the uh capitol police they're fully
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:43.600]   suited up in riot gear ready for whatever occurs here steve's police election so everybody knew
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:49.680]   what the rules were people on both sides knew how to play the rules before the game started
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:54.320]   not getting somewhere in the process and saying well you don't think it's going to benefit you
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:05:00.720]   so you try to go around the constitution that's not how our system works it's gotten out of hand
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:07.440]   and so president trump has called this out and president trump has stood up to it so many of us
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:13.440]   have stood up to it and in fact over a hundred of my colleagues madam speaker asked the supreme
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:20.400]   court to address this problem just a few weeks ago and unfortunately the court chose to punt
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:28.720]   they didn't answer right now but here's an update as of less than a minute ago hill staffers have
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:34.640]   been told to evacuate the madison building things are getting tenuous here as trump supporters and
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:40.480]   patriots continue to pour towards the capital alex jones himself at the head of a massive column
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:45.200]   of patriots moving now towards the united states capitol building we go back now to steve scalise
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:50.240]   who inside the capitol building is objecting to vote to counting the votes from arizona
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:56.560]   so every single republican voted to reform the process every single democrat voted against it
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:03.680]   they don't want to fix this problem but the constitution is our guide
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:10.560]   and it's time we start following the constitution it's time we get back to what our founding father
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:17.440]   said is the process for selecting electors that's the legislatures in public view not behind closed
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:22.960]   doors not smoke-filled rooms not bullying somebody that might give you a better ruling let's get back
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:29.040]   to rule of law and follow the constitution madam speaker and i yield back the balance of my time
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:37.360]   gentlemen's time is expired uh at steve scalise addressing the uh uh con the congressional house

[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:30.000]   evacuation orders as a consequence of this massive humanity that continues to blast their way through
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:36.480]   the flimsy barriers preventing them from getting close to the capitol incredible stuff folks here
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:42.720]   we're seeing videos that are being transmitted to us minute by minute as we receive updates from
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:48.640]   people on the ground independent journalists and just regular people alike meanwhile and here you
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:53.120]   see them pulling the barriers and the police struggling to pull it back this is not black
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:59.600]   lives matter folks this is not antifa these are patriots and perhaps they finally boiled over you
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:06.480]   see the air filled with the mist of mace the stinging gas that the police will be implementing
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:12.720]   and that is also being implemented against the police as patriots wow receiving blows to the head
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:18.400]   from billy clubs attempts to tear down barriers but once again folks this is but a small fraction
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:24.000]   of the upwards of a million people that are now in washington dc with the vast majority of them
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:30.720]   just now moving towards the capitol we expect this situation to become ever more dire here we see uh
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:36.960]   once again moving past what looks like the museum of uh natural history perhaps the air and space
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:42.640]   museum closing in on the capitol a column of humanity being led by alex jones with his iconic
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:48.640]   bullhorn and owen shroyer next to him uh the sheer number of people there makes it almost impossible
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:54.880]   to get signal out and that's the only thing really preventing us from uh getting completely live feeds
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:59.520]   right now but we're getting them about as quickly as we can fights have broken out between police
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:05.840]   officers and trump supporters in front of the capitol right now jim jordan is objecting to the
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:10.720]   uh to counting the electoral votes from arizona let's go down to jim jordan and hear what he has
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:21.040]   to say what if it's 10 states next time what if it's 15 what if in 2024 2028 it's 26 states what
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:28.720]   if it's half the states do an end run about the constitution clearly spells out we we are the
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:35.680]   final check and balance the authority rests with us the united states congress the body closest to
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:41.680]   the american people right where the founders wanted it we should do our duty we should
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:48.320]   object to and and and and vote for this objection to the arizona electors madam chair i yield back
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:56.880]   thank you objecting and laying out his reasonings for object for objection against this arizona so
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:02.000]   they go state by state to count the electors as of now only 12 have been counted i believe that's
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:08.960]   just from alaska uh so trump right now has those 12 electors biden still at zero as he would be
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:13.360]   awarded the arizona delegates except there has been an objection and now there's time for a
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:19.920]   debate adam schiff now uh presenting uh what i'm sure it can be summarized as b s american
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:27.120]   nationalists on twitter uh asking president trump to storm the senate chamber this day is young
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:33.280]   folks and who knows what will be uh what the what the future holds for us again elijah shaffer
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:37.920]   reports patriots have stormed the capitol building ground and are breaching federal barriers and
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:42.800]   police in mass no cell service video incoming of course we've seen that video we played it for you
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:50.000]   here non-lethal force in effect uh the barriers are continually uh being assaulted by the patriots
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.360]   as they move ever closer and surround an ever greater number the capitol building in washington
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:00.880]   dc punches mace being thrown and again the only thing preventing us from getting more videos right
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:06.080]   now is the fact that the sheer mass of humanity overloads the cell phone towers and it becomes
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:11.600]   impossible to get access to the internet or even to call in we're going to try to get the stream
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:16.720]   of alex jones and owen shawyer as they continue to approach it looks like blood on the ground i'm not
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:20.800]   sure if that's blood or something else but it looked like a great deal of human blood on the
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:26.400]   ground in front of the police line as police continue to lash out and attack they're in full
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:32.240]   riot gear full armor patriots no sign of slow of of stepping back or slowing down as they continue
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:37.840]   to push port towards these police lines of course inside this building right now the debate rages
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:44.240]   adam shift presenting some sort of um illiterate nonsense that we don't need to hear uh patriots
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:51.360]   storming the u.s capital an amazing video from uh the real hirsty uh via kitty boomhauer on uh on
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:58.560]   twitter these are the uh these are the people we rely on to get this up-to-date uh video because
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:04.960]   folks if you were watching fox news or newsmax or cnn you would receive nothing but a bland
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:12.880]   feed of essentially nothing going on instead we are giving you live up to the minute videos
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:18.640]   that are coming through over twitter from the live independent reporters there on the ground
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:24.800]   thousands hundreds of thousands of people right now moving towards the capital the mass of
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:32.640]   humanity continues to grow as the police lash out their thin line of armored officers a pitiful
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:39.200]   resistance against the literal tidal wave moving towards them and will continue to monitor all of
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:46.160]   this uh and get more videos as well folks uh guys do we have a feed of alex and owen moving towards
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:54.480]   or is that gone down because the cell phones this is all uh up to the minute folks uh the crew is
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:15:00.320]   working frantically behind the scenes to get all of this up to date once again this is coverage
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:05.680]   that you will not get anywhere else and all of this broke out almost immediately following
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:10.480]   president trump's statements is this the live feed of uh of alex and owen can we hear them
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:20.160]   and you see the crowd moving towards the capital now owen and alex at the head of a column of
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:25.760]   humanity going to join the already hundreds if not thousands of people now surrounding the capital
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:31.920]   and pushing ever closer the capital has evacuated two buildings the cannon building and the madison
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:37.280]   building have received evacuation orders and the people inside have been told to move calmly but
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:43.600]   swiftly towards the exit and to notify their superiors that they are safe folks this is uh
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:51.840]   this is truly incredible and we'll continue to uh keep you updated here looks like chuck schumer
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:58.560]   now no it's still adam shift still uh adam shift addressing the crowd and do we have audio of that
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:07.040]   stream if we can bring that up and hear what owen and uh and alex are saying
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:21.040]   this is history i mean i mean literally
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:29.520]   so
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:50.320]   surrounding alex jones and owen shroyer and the rest of the info wars crew as they move
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:55.680]   towards the capital here we see a view from inside the capital of staffers there moving down the
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:01.520]   stairs following that evacuation order uh mcconnell has said quote if we overrule them we damage our
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:07.120]   republic forever folks the republic has been damaged it now teeters on the brink of collapse
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:12.960]   what we're witnessing here live is unprecedented in american history and infowars.com is the only
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:18.800]   place bringing you these videos stay with us folks ladies and gentlemen this is truly incredible alex
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:24.240]   jones and owen shroyer at the head of a column of patriots moving towards the area where donald
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:31.360]   trump has just completed his speech to the save america crowd there my guest upwards of a million
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:36.080]   people on the streets of washington dc already hundreds of thousands surrounding the capital
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:42.160]   where inside the debate rages over whether or not to accept the electoral votes from the state of
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:48.160]   arizona this is just the beginning and as the debate rages inside outside police are struggling
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:54.400]   to maintain the fury of the crowds as barricades are pulled down mace is sprayed back and forth
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:18:01.840]   punches being thrown by both sides in what looks like what looks to be a uh the beginning of
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:07.680]   something huge folks we are receiving video updates from independent reporters on the ground
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:14.160]   and across the entire country as a rally at the minnesota state house in st paul has surrounded
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:20.400]   the capitol building there and again alex jones and owen shroyer moving towards that capital with
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:25.600]   the rest of this massive crowd which by the time trump was still speaking had already surrounded
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:30.960]   the capitol building two of the capitol buildings have been evacuated the madison building and the
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:36.560]   house cannon building it both received evacuation orders and the staffers there have moved towards
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:44.880]   the exit as the uh capitol police feel like they may not be able to maintain maintain the security
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:51.200]   or integrity of their police line uh here we see applause taking place in the senate we've heard
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:56.560]   from jim jordan we've heard from steve scalise uh now there's uh this scumbag which i think
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:01.200]   something bad happened to him so now everybody's sad for him but let's not forget he's a traitorous
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:05.760]   scumbag in the end i can't remember his name but frankly i don't care to here you see in the bottom
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:10.800]   right hand of the screen the capitol building staffers moving towards the exit clearly they
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:16.240]   don't seem distressed nobody's running they're all moving slowly looking at their phones or filming
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:22.160]   with their cameras but still this is an incredible event and once again it was a small fraction of a
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:28.080]   fraction of the total crowd i was already at this capitol building when the conflict began and now
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:36.160]   the remainder of that huge almost unprecedented crowd is moving towards uh the capitol as we speak
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:41.360]   as the debate rages inside president trump has apparently returned to the white house that's the
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:46.000]   word that we're receiving from washington he said he was going to go to the capitol but it looks
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.800]   like he's gone to the white house instead many people on twitter encouraging him to storm the
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:56.800]   senate along with his supporters and what we're seeing here are the independent journalist videos
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:03.360]   as trump supporters move once again inexorably towards the capitol building the police seem to
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:09.760]   be scrambling running back and forth unsure which way to go and trump flags waving american wags
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:19.760]   waving waving uh gadsden flags waving and the uh joyous uh you know uh uh upbeat atmosphere of
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:26.560]   the event earlier today has soured and turned to rage as the fury of trump supporters and
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:33.200]   patriots across the united states overflows and expresses itself on the outside of the capitol
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:41.040]   it looks like uh ted cruz is now addressing the house we'd like to get that feed as soon as
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:46.320]   possible an aerial view provided by fox shows the massive and ever-growing crowd
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:54.880]   alex jones continuing to move towards uh the the capitol there one of the only issues that's
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:21:01.280]   preventing us from getting more live feeds is the fact that the sheer number of people overloads
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:08.720]   the cell phone towers and internet connections become inconsistent at best but the massive crowd
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:15.280]   continues to grow a u.s bomb squad uh battalion dispatch has arrived on the scene as well we're
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:20.240]   not sure if that's because of a reported bomb threat or whether they're just there as backup
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:27.600]   as it seems like the u.s capitol police are struggling to maintain their cohesion as more
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:32.720]   and more people surround the capitol building and push towards those senate and congressional
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:37.680]   chambers where as we speak objections are being made to the fraudulent vote that occurred in
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:46.240]   arizona two buildings of the u.s uh capitol complex evacuated of course and uh once again
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:51.840]   it looks like the supply of uh of videos has slowed down a bit we'll uh keep pulling them
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:57.840]   in as we can oh here we see uh trump supporters are running as they move towards the capitol it
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:02.720]   looks like these stands have already been erected for the supposed inauguration which should be
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:07.280]   happening on january 20th uh that's where you see some of the preparations being made outside the
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:15.760]   capitol and uh now uh being torn down by angry trump supporters this is a video from drew hernandez
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:21.920]   who is on the scene elijah shaffer on the scene julio rosas on the scene we see police officers
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:26.240]   falling down as they're pushed and being pulled up by their brethren trump supporters scaling
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:33.680]   the scaffolding that's been erected to support the uh audience there during uh for the uh for
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:40.240]   the inauguration on january 20th looks like ted cruz has objected breaking now from hannity.com
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:46.880]   ted cruz objects to arizona's electoral college results senate to debate so as we speak the senate
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:51.600]   and the congress are both in session it's a joint session of congress they are uh deciding whether
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:59.440]   not to accept the results that have been put forward to them uh which means that this is the
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:05.520]   deciding factor right now and they go alphabetical order alaska has been decided 12 electoral votes
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:11.440]   went to trump uh because of alaska right now biden sits at zero because as soon as arizona came up
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:17.360]   the objections came in and now it's the time for argumentation and we may see what happens here of
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:24.320]   course vice president mike pence was in a position to outright object and decide on his own based on
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:30.720]   some uh constitutional precedents set over a hundred years ago he has rejected that
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:36.800]   responsibility that obligation he said no i can't do that i have to leave it up to the legislature
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:45.200]   so now we have legislatures and senators arguing in favor or in opposition to the acceptance of the
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:52.000]   electoral slates that have been sent from these various states and once again we're seeing rallies
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:59.600]   all across the united states with a rally in minnesota and elsewhere breaking up uh breaking
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:07.360]   off as well and again these videos coming out from outside the capital show a very thin police line
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:14.640]   heavily armored with the the masks the uh swat helmets the swat shields full body armor carrying
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:19.440]   billy clubs that look to be about three feet long we're seeing trump supporters taking hits on the
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:26.320]   head from those uh billy clubs and again this was as of 24 minutes ago and since then we've seen
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:33.200]   24 minutes of rising uh aggression rising crowds more police building evacuations
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:43.520]   and the reaction from across the nation is largely excitement as far as i'm concerned this is again
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:50.080]   truly incredible and we'll continue to update and bring you more videos we're not exactly sure where
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:56.160]   owen shroyer and alex jones have arrived at this point they were about a mile away probably 20
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:01.120]   minutes ago so they should be approaching the capital now problem is once again not only have
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:08.400]   the cell phone towers been overloaded by the sheer mass of humanity all of their cell phones attempting
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:12.720]   to get a piece of those networks and they inevitably go down that's to be expected but
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:18.000]   what i've noticed is that we haven't received a new video in about nine minutes and i wonder if
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:23.680]   there hasn't been some sort of shutdown of the cell network to prevent information from getting
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:29.040]   out but we continue to monitor the situation on every different front uh if you guys want to bring
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:34.400]   up this fox news feed we can at least see oh here's a here's a shot from the back of the capital
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:40.640]   grounds shooting towards the place where the inauguration is set to commence on january 20th
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:48.160]   massive massive crowds again moving we see police running we see capital staffers evacuating as the
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:54.880]   trump flags wave the american flags wave the gadson flags wave and the patriots move ever
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:26:00.160]   closer we see police being helped away from the scene perhaps injured perhaps sprayed with mace
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:06.160]   perhaps a friendly fire of mace from his own side getting back in his own eyes that's we've seen
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:10.400]   mostly mace being sprayed from the police lines but we've also seen mace being sprayed right back
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:15.360]   from the trump supporters towards the police and this is an ongoing situation as the crowd
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:21.680]   continues to swell continues to surround the capital and the police are struggling to maintain
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:31.520]   it this is this is uh unprecedented ladies and gentlemen this is perhaps the focal point the
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:39.040]   changing point the fulcrum upon which the fate of the republic rests more senators and congressmen
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:44.960]   objecting police it looks like being escorted off perhaps injured being assisted by their
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:50.400]   fellow officers we don't know if they have received a blow to the face or if they've been
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:56.560]   maced we do know is that the washington establishment is scrambling any and all officers
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:03.520]   they have at their command in order to deal with this massive outpouring of anger fury and
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:10.080]   righteous indignation coming from the trump supporters you can there see we have the uh
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:15.360]   fox news feed up and even they are having trouble maintaining the integrity of their signal
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:21.680]   and uh we see some of their videos glitching and fading out folks this is the alex jones show my
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:26.320]   name is harrison smith because alex jones himself is on the scene and we will do our best to connect
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:31.280]   with him and owen schroyer and to see what is going on as patriots scale the scaffolding the
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:38.880]   barriers come down and the righteous fury of the american people overwhelms the pathetic structure
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:46.480]   of this corrupt system folks it's the alex jones show what an incredible day to be on infowars.com
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:52.800]   what we're seeing now are up to the minute videos i mean this is just incredible looks like blood
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:28:00.240]   on the ground bear mace being sprayed some sort of other material being sprayed over the over the
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:07.520]   capitol police going back and forth we have an update about the evacuation uh the the story is
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:13.200]   that a pipe bomb was recorded hence the evacuation of the two capitol hill buildings although it's
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:18.800]   been all cleared now and uh congressional staffers or capitol staffers are now reporting that they
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:24.480]   got the all clear in order to head back in so perhaps that evacuation was not as a response to
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:31.600]   the crowd which continues to hammer at and get in conflict with this thin line of of riot police
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:37.600]   fully armored up like uh medieval knights here in their full body armor their face mask their helmet
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:42.560]   and their massive billy club you can see them dragging trump supporters uh away from the other
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:49.120]   patriots as they arrest them arrests are being made uh billy clubs are being used riot shields
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:55.040]   are in place and pushing back uh and there you see the commander in the back uh issuing orders
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:29:08.000]   this is uh this is again completely unprecedented after a year or more of uh riots and uh cacophony
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:15.520]   from the left of uh antifa and black lives matter uh attacking police at every turn uh this is the
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:23.680]   first time that we've seen a similar reaction from the patriots as they surround and enclose
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:29.920]   the oh my god that's incredible a massive wooden cross has now been erected at the foot of the
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:36.000]   capitol steps it's at least 20 feet tall uh truly incredible and that's that's real wood i mean you
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:41.760]   can tell from the weight as they leverage it up and into the stand that is not and it's not made
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:48.800]   out of styrofoam folks that's a heavy wooden cross being erected as a symbol of defiance to the
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:56.960]   satanist pedophile networks that are attempting at this very moment to overthrow our ability to
[01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:01.440]   govern ourselves and it looks like this is perhaps at the capitol building at madison am i wrong
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:11.120]   in that this is uh wisconsin where is it uh bethany where oh today is epiphany okay yeah
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:16.960]   well hey uh symbolic significance there i believe that so right now we have all over america massive
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:21.280]   protests breaking out at capitol buildings at states all over the place i believe that was a
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:28.000]   different one because i saw snow on the ground there which uh i believe is uh must have come from
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:33.280]   that's from the capital but that's not it's not the u.s capital though it's not the american
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:41.120]   capital uh the the dc capital i think that is uh probably madison but we'll figure that out
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:47.600]   uh los angeles as well as stop the steel rally lining the streets hundreds of trump supporters
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:54.480]   people cheering it on on twitter saying saying drag them out saying go into the capitol building
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:31:01.840]   and drag the traders out as things continue to escalate here from julio rosas capital
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:06.960]   capitol police push the trump supporters back and use a lot of pepper spray as more videos
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:12.000]   are being posted by him and other independent reporters now meanwhile if you're going to be
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.320]   watching something like fox news or cnn all you're going to see is one of two things you're either
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:23.280]   going to see a very uh wide shot of crowds somewhere in washington dc it looks like they've
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:28.800]   got a shot on freedom plaza as people slowly meander towards uh the capitol city or you're
[01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:33.200]   going to see inside the senate chambers where the argumentation is now taking place on whether or
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:39.280]   not to accept the arizona electoral slate giving them to joe biden the objection has been made
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:44.880]   and in both the senate and the congress arguments are being made back and forth uh we heard that uh
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:49.600]   congresswoman uh bobert was interrupted and we're trying to figure out what that was about it looked
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:54.800]   like some contention there she was speaking and objecting and then she was forced to stop and sat
[01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:58.400]   down and was speaking up and we'll try to figure out what was going on there where the rules were
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:03.440]   violated whether she was prevented from presenting her case but we'll continue to bring all of this
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:09.360]   to you up to the minute and we'll get a live feed from the infowars crews there on the ground
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:16.160]   at this uh crucible moment as general flint put it folks uh i haven't plugged once but hey in the
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:20.720]   last 15 seconds of this segment infowarsstore.com is what is supporting all of this everything that
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:25.280]   we're seeing here reporting that you will not get anywhere else on network tv on the internet
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:30.480]   nowhere else is bringing you this type of material and the video straight from the capitol this is

[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:45.680]   patriots pour towards the capitol building it looks like our feed our live feed from the capitol with
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:53.360]   alex jones uh is back up again once again the sheer number of people there uh is overloading
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:59.760]   the cell phone systems and so the feed for anybody us fox news scene and everybody's having trouble
[01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:06.160]   getting video out although we're bringing it to you as soon as possible up to the minute uh video
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:13.360]   flash bangs are reported to have been uh launched there are people such as uh dana lash saying stop
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:18.560]   this to trump supporters who are moving towards the capitol other people saying get in there and
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:24.320]   tear them out oh here we see my god these images are just incredible massive numbers of patriots
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:30.880]   storming the capitol building texas flags waving american flags waving and masses of humanity have
[01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:35.600]   apparently broken past the police barricades which were keeping them off the steps and away from the
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:42.960]   capitol building they have been uh torn down and the people have moved on to that raised platform
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:50.400]   and are scaling the scaffolding that was set up previously for the inauguration that is to take
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:55.840]   place on january 20th here we see the flash bangs and the gas grenades being launched over the heads
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:03.680]   of the front lines into the ranks of the patriots uh really really incredible again this is all up
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:10.560]   to the minute stuff taking place and we'll bring it to you all just as quickly as possible
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:15.200]   the barricade oh my gosh yeah images of barricades completely torn and ripped apart
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:20.640]   laying on the ground as patriots move past it we've got views of the patriots of the steps of
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:26.480]   the capitol building and yes i do have it confirmed that it was uh it's the michigan
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:32.640]   capitol building uh in front of which this massive wooden cross has been raised by christian patriots
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:37.600]   who are sick and tired of their heritage their religion their belief system being
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:45.840]   denigrated and desecrated by the satanic forces that have occupied our great country
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:54.320]   so in a symbol of defiance to the worldly secular ruling class a massive wooden cross has been
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:35:01.040]   erected in front of the capitol building in the state of michigan as a protest erupt throughout
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:09.280]   the country as uh vice president mike pence has refused or rejected his responsibility or
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:17.680]   obligation to reject or determine exactly which electoral votes to consider now the debate
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:22.480]   continues to rage and it looks like yes they have gotten onto the balconies they've gone up the
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:27.840]   stairs the barricades have fallen the police have retreated although we continue to see clashes and
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:34.480]   perhaps they're just regrouping but this energy has to main has to be maintained and here we see
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:42.400]   a view from earlier today during president trump's speech of just the innumerable trump supporters
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:47.360]   waving flags and they're in support of the president's and in defiance of what we're told
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:53.760]   was a completely fair election the most secure election of all time those lies no longer hold
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:36:00.480]   weight they no longer carry water with the vast majority of americans in this country let's go
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:05.440]   again do we have that feed from alex jones and owen schroyer as they're there live on the ground
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:09.440]   we'll bring you that and just as soon as he gets back up here it is i don't know if we want to go
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:13.440]   to it quite yet
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:25.760]   here's the thing folks we are more aware of what's happening than they are right now they may be on
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:29.360]   the ground and we'll be getting their perspective just as soon as possible and they'll have
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:35.040]   information that we don't have but as of right now we have the luxury of having eyes in many places
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:42.160]   we're receiving videos updates and rumors and all sorts of stuff from various different corners all
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:47.520]   being aggregated here and then presented to you whereas if you're on the ground all you know is
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:53.360]   what you see for yourself since with the overloaded cell systems you're not going to be able to check
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:58.480]   twitter if you're there so you're actually probably more aware of what's going on as a whole
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:02.880]   surrounding the entire capital than alex jones and owen schroyer are themselves despite the fact that
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:10.960]   they're there on the ground and we can just hear the rolling chants of usa fight for trump
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:21.280]   incredible this crowd continues to swell uh what was it i mean i've lost track of time i think it
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:28.160]   was less than an hour ago uh an hour ago that president trump finished his speech and that
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:32.560]   massive crowd of hundreds of thousands probably upwards of a million people surrounding the
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:38.400]   washington monument and all the way to the white house uh finished watching that speech by president
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:45.280]   trump and moved towards the u.s capital and by the time that uh here we see an update from ilhan
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:49.680]   omar currency the capital buildings are locked down and everyone is sheltering in place hey so
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:55.040]   look that's where ilhan omar is everyone just kidding uh massive crowds yeah you can see those
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:38:01.840]   in the distance as they move towards capital and once again inside the capital building right now
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:09.120]   our debate is raging as to whether or not to accept this fraudulent election on live tv news
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:14.000]   max reporter ordered to the capital basement due to a bomb threat near the rotunda again we think
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:21.200]   that was a not a legitimate threat as it was called all here and the evacuation orders were
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:26.800]   rescinded trump supporters have been ordered to disperse but it doesn't look like they're going
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:35.520]   anywhere and we're seeing more and more destruction taking place rioters riders have injured a capital
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:39.120]   city police officer in front of capital building you saw that video earlier of the police being
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:45.680]   helped away from the crowd by his compatriots we think that to me it looks like something got in
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:49.280]   his eyes it looks like perhaps he got pepper sprayed may have been friendly fire or it may
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:54.080]   have been owned here we have carolyn breman views from inside the capital as people gather on the
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:39:01.600]   west front the capital is currently on lockdown massive crowds totally surrounding the capital
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:08.880]   angry trump supporters aware of the fraud cognizant of the betrayal that is being carried
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:14.720]   out at this very moment inside the capital building they continue to push forward reorganize
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:25.600]   regain footing and move ever forward once again folks the communication networks are completely
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:30.960]   overloaded with the sheer mass of people so getting any first-hand information about this
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:37.200]   is going to be difficult but we'll continue to bring as up to the minute updates as we possibly
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:48.720]   can protesters have breached police lines and are now on the steps of the u.s capital again
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:55.280]   the rolling cheers of usa usa us capital on lockdown now during the electoral vote count
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:40:02.720]   and as far as we know the vote count has stalled out at 12 for president trump and zero for
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:10.080]   president so-called president-elect biden as they only got through alaska before arizona was up the
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:15.920]   objections came in and the debate began we don't know if this debate will be uh continued and
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:24.400]   carried on as lockdown continues or whether they may pause and try to reassess what exactly is
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:31.920]   going on and how to deal with it of course the congressmen and women and senators i don't think
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:37.120]   are at much of a threat we know there's one thing they take very very seriously it is their own
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:43.520]   personal well-being and their own security there are tunnels of course crisscrossing like spider
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:50.160]   webs throughout all of dc and there's almost no risk of them having to try to escape through a
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:56.000]   crowd or having to bunker down in the capital building they have escape routes more than they
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:01.120]   need so again i do not think there's actually a bodily threat to anybody in the chambers at this
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:06.640]   moment they don't seem too concerned they're continuing to argue continuing to debate without
[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:11.920]   so much as a look over their shoulder as to the doors being broken down or anything like that this
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:18.800]   is simply a massive protest that is refusing to stay quiet any longer that is making themselves
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:25.680]   known that is not stopping at the barricades not kowtowing and adhering to the police who have
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:31.280]   betrayed us time and time again but instead are pushing forward to take over what is at the heart
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:38.480]   of it our building it's our as americans this building belongs to us this capital belongs to
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:44.240]   us and it is being stolen from us at this very minute live and the american people are attempting
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:49.920]   to prevent that from taking place once again i don't believe that people inside the capitol
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:54.160]   building are concerned about this whatsoever at least in terms of their safety or anything like
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:59.040]   that if anything were to happen if the doors were to be the breach they would be evacuated rapidly
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:04.080]   they'd disappear into underground tunnels and be moved to a safe house far out of harm's way so
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:08.400]   we aren't too concerned for them but we'll continue to keep you updated and bring you
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:13.600]   videos just as soon as we get them ladies and gentlemen this is history being made as we speak
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:19.840]   capital on lockdown the capitol police over the radio are heard to say we have lost control i
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:24.480]   repeat we have lost control from eliza shafer breaking trump supporters have breached all
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:29.280]   security barriers and are now actively destroying and occupying the capitol building i repeat the
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:35.360]   feds have lost control of the capitol building a revolution is in progress this is not a drill
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:40.880]   trump supporters breaching all security barriers and am now actively destroying and occupying the
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:46.640]   capitol building this is incredible two buildings of the u.s capital complex evacuated as trump
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:52.800]   supporters clash with the police flashbangs being fired over the front lines into the crowd of
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:43:00.640]   trump supporters but it seems like those attempts to prevent the onrush of patriots has failed these
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:06.160]   security barriers have fallen one by one and the capital is now being occupied and according to
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:12.080]   elijah shafer destroyed by patriots we're seeing live feeds from fox news as the crowds continue
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:17.360]   to swell continue to grow the american flags continue to wave as the patriots move towards
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:23.440]   the united states capitol building and continue to occupy it here we're seeing a live view from
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:29.600]   inside the capitol building perhaps from a staffer as they look at the thin line of the the thin
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:35.360]   barrier of wood and glass separating them from hordes of angry americans u.s capital on total
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:42.960]   lockdown certification vote has been paused as protests continue to erupt the senate has adjourned
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:48.320]   abruptly mike vice president mike pence has been rushed off the senate senate floor trump
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:53.840]   supporters have breached the u.s capitol building we're seeing images within the halls of congress
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:44:00.000]   and within the halls of the capitol of trump supporters who have breached those doors two
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:04.960]   capitol hill buildings have been evacuated by the uscp and we're also hearing that the private
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:11.520]   residences on capitol hill are being evacuated as well senators the vice president the congressman
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:16.640]   now no doubt making their way towards the security of the underground tunnels to escort them away
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:22.720]   from the threat of their supposed constituents angry furious and now venting that frustration
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:28.000]   on the system that has betrayed them time and time again this is just incredible folks you're
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:33.520]   watching infowars this is the alex jones show alex jones is right now at the scene they're sort of on
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:39.520]   the edge we are receiving intermittent streams from them as the cell phone networks are overloaded
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:44.640]   and now and information becomes harder to come by what we know is that alex jones and own schroyer
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:50.000]   are not at the head of this they are not the ones breaking into the capitol but they they are there
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:56.960]   on the periphery watching this receiving this information in real time truly incredible dc is
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:03.280]   now in control of the patriots as an officer of the united states capitol police radios
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:09.360]   the phrase we have lost control i repeat we have lost control protesters now inside the capitol
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:14.400]   building those marble stair staircases being trot upon by patriots who are raising their
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:19.680]   hands showing they are peaceful yet they aren't going anywhere as one after another the security
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:26.800]   barriers have fallen vp mike pence evacuated from the capitol building trump loyalists storm
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:31.920]   us capitol tear gas deployed few arrests made the police have lost control barricades torn down
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:38.320]   buildings evacuated the press has been moved to the basement as they scramble to avoid the on press
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:45.280]   of millions at least i would say my estimation a million trump supporters having moved from
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:50.800]   throughout dc and are now converging on the capitol this is revolution in progress this is
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:56.080]   a major historic moment in the history of the united states it is a privilege and an honor to
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:46:01.040]   be here sharing it with you and bringing you updates just as soon as possible we're getting
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:08.080]   information you will not get anywhere else we are receiving videos and updates in a faster method
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:16.960]   than any other network mainstream or otherwise here we see okay now we have a battalion of neon
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:22.720]   shirted police the the backup has been called they're moving slowly but surely towards the
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:28.400]   capitol but it may be already too late the doors have been breached the patriots are inside the
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:35.120]   senate has ceased debating because the vote has been uh paused the vote on certification has been
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:41.440]   paused and the entire building is being evacuated folks we've seen it for four years we've seen
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:48.320]   the anger of the left we saw it under kavanagh as uh the the protesters who fell for the lie time
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:55.680]   after time again screech and claw impotently at the door we've seen six months or more of violent
[01:46:55.680 --> 01:47:01.760]   protest burning down entire cities aimless pointless destruction being wrought across the
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:08.000]   united states by liberal and communist agitators all to the point of trying to tear down our system
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:15.360]   now we see not the system fight back but those who love america fight back patriots now taking over
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:21.760]   the entire capitol steps continuing to wave the american flag the gadson flag the tree of liberty
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:28.640]   flag the trump flag they've taken it over it is done this is what happens when americans rise up
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:34.800]   this is what happens when patriots do what the communists have been trying to do for so long
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:43.440]   again this is not an impotent pointless nonsense protest based off misinformation like the death of
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:49.360]   george floyd who killed himself with fentanyl or jacob blake who just yesterday was proven he was
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:55.600]   armed and dangerous when police rightfully uh took him down uh or the the lies of brett kavanagh for
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:48:01.600]   four years we've seen the outrageous and yet impotent uh lashing out of leftists throughout
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:07.440]   america and for the first time it seems after having shown patience of the you know that of
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:12.160]   angels the uh americans the trump supporters who've seen their lives destroyed they've seen
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:16.960]   their businesses shut down they've seen the lockdown uh perpetuated all across america
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:23.520]   destroying our economy surrendering to china over and over again uh stories that expose
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:30.720]   the corruption and the underselling of america to communist china the other foreign powers
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:37.360]   have gone ignored have been suppressed have been shut down time and time again the american people
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:43.600]   have shrugged and taken the blows on the back without so much as a whimper in protest but
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:49.040]   finally they have pushed too far after stealing our last resort we always knew in the back of
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:53.120]   our minds in the back of our heads we had the numbers we had the will we could through the
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:58.720]   electoral process maintain some semblance of control over what is supposed to be our
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:05.200]   representative democracy our republic well they stole that from us they took away the final
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:11.120]   lifeline they destroyed the final pressure valve and now the rage of the american people overflows
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:17.120]   as patriots storm into the united states capital waving trump flags waving american flags waving
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:22.720]   the gadson flag taking over the steps pushing through the doors and forcing an evacuation
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:29.280]   of our representatives as they halt the vote counting process where this goes from here
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:35.840]   only time will tell we'll continue to get updates videos images and breaking news from all over
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:40.640]   the internet here we're getting it all from independent sources independent reporters who
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:45.920]   are providing us with on the ground views sometimes even within the capital as it looks
[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:52.880]   like the press moves away and retreats as more and more trump supporters and patriots pour into
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:58.160]   the capital we have a tweet from donald trump one minute ago mike pence didn't have the courage to
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:01.760]   do what should have been done to protect our country and our constitution giving states a
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:07.040]   chance to certify a correct set of facts not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones they were asked to
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:12.480]   previously certify u.s demands the truth and here we have alex jones in front of the capital do we
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:19.840]   have audio on this just giant crowds of hundreds of thousands everywhere they took the scaffolding
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:25.120]   stage it's being set up that joe biden says he won't use it he's installed on the 20th uh trump
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:32.240]   says he's there's massive evidence of fraud we've all said we want to be peaceful like the left and
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:38.240]   shoots cops and burns down apartment buildings and fire departments and police stations and things
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:44.880]   and run around terrorizing america that's the left that's antifa that's blm but americans are mad and
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:49.600]   so when they stage elections in venezuela are they saying alex jones more on the other side
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:54.160]   the capital has fallen the patriots are in control ladies and gentlemen history is being
[01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:59.280]   made as we speak this just in as of less than a minute ago rotunda door has now been breached
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:04.480]   capital police say trump protesters surged into the building that's going to disclose tv who shows
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:11.040]   an overhead shot of this massive crowd moving towards the capital we're seeing uh shots from
[01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:16.320]   inside now the trump protesters here shots from inside now you can see the glass there and the
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:21.280]   wood door that i believe this is the eastern door of the capital and you can see the protesters
[01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:25.680]   asking the people inside hey push the door open push the door open and not even attempting to
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:31.360]   break the glass not attempting to cause uh trouble or to to cause damage but rather trying to get
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:37.200]   the people inside to act as patriots themselves open the door and put it into this farce of an
[01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:45.200]   election that we've been witness to uh this entire time truly incredible stuff uh darren j bd on
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:50.560]   twitter says the fbi should take a knee to show respect to the maga protesters yeah maybe if uh
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:55.760]   maybe if black lives matter was there the police would uh be on our side instead the police have
[01:51:55.760 --> 01:52:00.400]   fallen back the senate chambers have been evacuated the vote counting the certification
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:05.120]   of the electors has been suspended for the time being as they deal with the fact that protesters
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:11.440]   are now within the capital here we're seeing uh physical combat taking place inside the capital
[01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:16.640]   between the pillars mace being sprayed punches being thrown protesters going head to head with
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:21.600]   the capital city police who have fallen back to inside the building and are pretending and are
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:30.480]   attempting to prevent the onslaught the onrush of these trump protesters now before the debate was
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:36.320]   uh ceased mcconnell had said the election was not stolen as trump says mcconnell claims there
[01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:42.480]   was no massive collection of fraud mcconnell says congress can't make itself a board of elections
[01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:51.680]   amazing isn't it absolutely amazing the utter failure of the republicans to uh wield any sort
[01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:59.440]   of institutional power in at the behest of or to the benefit of their own people the election fraud
[01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:07.040]   as enumerated earlier today by donald trump is in the millions the provable ones is at least the
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:12.480]   hundreds of thousands he pointed out the hundreds of thousands of people in detroit in georgia in
[01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:19.360]   michigan and minnesota and elsewhere of non-registered voters of uh registered voters
[01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:26.640]   who you know more votes than registered voters in detroit you had 139 votes i mean this doesn't
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:33.600]   make any sense this is incredible this is nonsense and yet it goes unopposed by the republicans with
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:40.720]   the power to do anything about it they instead abrogate that power and refuse to exert their
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:46.480]   constitutional authority instead wanting to do anything they can to simply get rid of president
[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:51.840]   trump so they can get back to the status quo back to business as usual which is of course the
[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:57.520]   continual selling out of the american people the continual undermining of our heritage and our
[01:53:57.520 --> 01:54:04.320]   nation and the continual surrendering of everything we hold dear to those who would destroy us and
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:10.720]   make no bones about it this is from their own mouths we're seeing now on fox news and elsewhere
[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:19.360]   just the sheer crowds all over the the capital steps waving stop the steel signs waving american
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:24.800]   flags for the for the time being at least the steel has been stopped we have uh no we're no
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:31.920]   longer counting the no longer counting the votes no longer uh debating the certification it has all
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:40.720]   ground to a halt it has all ceased to continue as the lawmakers and the other capital hill staffers
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:46.560]   flee in fear of their safety two buildings of the u.s capital complex were evacuated
[01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:54.560]   flashbangs have been launched into the the trump protester lines the barricades are being torn down
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:55:00.160]   this is just another peaceful protest folks these trump supporters are just ideas after all
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:06.240]   i say that uh in jest obviously but uh you know if you really think about it so far nothing's been
[01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:10.960]   burned down no innocent people have been uh knocked out and then kicked in the head while
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:16.240]   they lay on the on the pavement and this has not scratched the surface of the type of violence chaos
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:21.760]   and destruction that we've seen wrought across this entire nation for an entire year without uh
[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:28.160]   the slightest hint of protest from the democrats in fact they support them they join them right now
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:34.000]   what we're seeing is not uh george soros funded this is not people trained by the communist
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:40.560]   chinese like black lives matter leaders admit to being this is a natural spontaneous event
[01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:45.840]   being carried out by trump supporters from all over the nation we also have incredible images
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:51.360]   of the michigan state house outside of which a massive wooden cross has been erected as a
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:58.400]   symbol of defiance to the satanic pedophile network that has slowly but surely captured at each and
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:03.840]   every institution that governs this once great nation truly incredible stuff do we still have
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:11.280]   that feed from alex jones alex jones alex jones and aren't sure are alive on the scene we're having
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:18.240]   trouble getting connected to them because of the overwhelming number of people has uh as i said
[01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:24.400]   overwhelmed the cellular networks absolutely massive scenes inside the capitol building
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:31.520]   of protesters making their way up and down the marble staircases as of four minutes ago we see
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:38.400]   uh somebody videoing down the down the staircases out the windows as they see these patriots move
[01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:45.600]   towards them they then turn and run to safety as we said before uh although things have escalated
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:50.240]   since then i don't believe that any of our representatives are actually themselves at risk
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:57.600]   of physical injury uh there's enough uh planning and uh uh you know things in place preparations
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:03.440]   have been made to where those people can very rapidly evacuate and get out into the tunnels
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:10.160]   beneath the streets of washington dc where they can be uh secreted away ferried away to uh safety
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:16.160]   i don't have too much fear for uh this becoming bloody or violent unless of course the police
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:22.320]   start to uh clash back and push back here we're saying i mean just incredible images folks this
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:28.080]   is a day that will go down in history we're seeing uh protesters they're scaling the very
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:37.680]   walls of the capital scaling the scaffolding that uh once was uh erected to uh for the inauguration
[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:43.920]   on january 20th and yes we're seeing images here that will go down in history this is
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:49.040]   a major moment in america whether it will come to anything or not i guess we'll have to just wait
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:54.880]   and see and we'll continue to bring you updates as we get them again two of the capital buildings
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:58:01.840]   were evacuated earlier because of apparently the threat of a pipe bomb that has been withdrawn those
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:08.240]   buildings no longer have that stand down order issued or that evacuation order rather issued
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:15.280]   but it seems like the residential buildings around capitol hill are being evacuated and the senate
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:22.080]   and congress themselves have been evacuated and are no longer taking part in the debate or the
[01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:26.800]   certification of votes here we see a protester holding a riot shield that he probably got from
[01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:33.760]   a police officer windows being broken and tentatively here we go the patriots moving in
[01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:42.880]   towards moving into the capital building this is incredible folks there you go using the riot shield
[01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:50.720]   to bash through the windows of the capital using large pieces of wood that were no doubt there uh
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:58.560]   for the uh for the scaffolding and yeah we're seeing patriots move in they've surrounded the
[01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:02.480]   capital building they've broken through the barriers they're now breaking the windows and
[01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:09.840]   making their way into the capital building uh from the dc police from the
[01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:16.640]   now now that my god now the protesters have gotten their hands on fire extinguishers and

[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:17.760]   the dome of the capital tear gas is being fired uh we have uh from cnn supporters of president

[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:26.880]   cnn believe it or not uh we don't need to hear from the capitol police when we see it with our
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:32.400]   own eyes trump supporters chase away the outnumbered capitol police and throw objects at them uh we're
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:38.960]   seeing there inside the capital and outside uh patriots swarming throughout we're going to try
[02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:44.720]   to find uh try to find more information about this shooting that has been reported we don't know
[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:52.480]   whether this is uh bullets being fired or whether this is tear gas canisters perhaps being fired ted
[02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:58.080]   cruz says violence is always unacceptable even when passions run highs uh run high here we do
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:02.240]   here we have edo keefe reports that a congressional aide says members were told to get under the
[02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:08.880]   chairs in the house chamber here we see my god we see uh members inside the senate chambers piling
[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:16.320]   up furniture to block the doors as protesters move ever towards the center of our republic this is
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:22.400]   absolutely mind-blowing they say they're shooting into the chamber so perhaps and that goes along
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:28.400]   with the the image that you're seeing here so perhaps they are uh the members of piled
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:34.000]   furniture to block the doors trump supporters outnumbering the capitol police and driving them
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:39.600]   away throwing uh objects at them uh trump supporters scaling the walls of the capitol
[02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:47.760]   breaking into the capitol uh they've secured uh fire extinguishers and are uh blowing them in the
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:56.160]   face of the the capitol hill uh staff there that's tempting to video or film what's going on this is
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:03:03.280]   incredible folks okay yeah we already saw that i want to hear more about this uh the supposed
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:09.760]   shooting from disclosed tv protesters are smashing the doors to the u.s house chamber that's image
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:15.040]   that we saw just a second ago of the furniture being piled up in a attempt to prevent or at
[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:20.880]   least waylay or delay the breaking into the house chamber there uh u.s senate chamber has been
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:25.840]   evacuated and senators are being taken to a secure location house members are being instructed to put
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:32.800]   on masks as tear gas is now inside the u.s capitol dome folks this is again unprecedented this is
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:42.080]   history being made as we speak uh via mep fuller shots fired into the u.s house chamber we don't
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:48.160]   know if that is an armed protester or if those are uh officers firing or if that's tear gas
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:52.480]   all we've heard is that shots are being fired into the u.s house chamber as protesters are
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:58.720]   smashing the door to that house chamber and the representatives are piling furniture up to block
[02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:06.800]   that door uh again elijah shaffer inside nancy plos's plosie's office and they didn't even have
[02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:15.760]   time to sign out of their uh computers leaving the no doubt uh should be secured programs wide open
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:20.400]   for anybody and everybody to see okay it looks like those are police on either side of the door
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:25.200]   with guns so as the protesters are attempting to break down the door shots are being fired
[02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:32.640]   we don't know if that's uh if they're being fired into the cap into the uh chamber there but we
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:38.560]   definitely see at least three guns being leveled from inside the chamber to the door you know at
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:46.960]   the door firing at the protesters outside of that door folks this is this is history being made as
[02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:52.480]   we speak where this goes from here it is anybody's guess but it doesn't look like it will be calming
[02:04:52.480 --> 02:05:01.840]   down or uh ending anytime soon we're receiving updates from a variety of sources here as we
[02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:11.520]   continue to to monitor what is going on my god folks let's keep rolling some of these uh some
[02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:15.680]   of these videos trump supporters again chasing away the capitol police the capitol police saying
[02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:23.200]   we've lost control uh hordes of trump supporters now uh posted up on the front steps of the capitol
[02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:28.320]   and you can see outside the capitol hundreds of thousands of more trump supporters moving
[02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:33.600]   ever towards this building this symbol of our once great country that has been occupied by
[02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:38.560]   globalist forces for at least as long as i have been alive and it seems like the patience of the
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:45.440]   american people and the patriots who have tried and time and time and time again to work within
[02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:51.680]   the system to behave themselves and trust that the system would serve those that serve themselves well
[02:05:51.680 --> 02:05:58.160]   time and time again we have been rejected and rebuffed and so now that spirit of american
[02:05:58.160 --> 02:06:05.920]   resistance the revolution upon which our country was founded is not dead yet and rears its powerful
[02:06:05.920 --> 02:06:13.120]   head as we are watching live these various flags the betsy ross flag the uh episcopalian flag uh
[02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:17.120]   would you mind would you guys mind throwing up that warning uh back on the screen once again we
[02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:25.280]   had a warning from the mayor of dc mariel bowser who i believe has issued a curfew is issued an
[02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:31.920]   emergency shutdown here it is mayor bowser issues city-wide curfew for dc for wednesday january 6
[02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:36.640]   starting at 6 p.m until thursday january 7th at 6 a.m essential workers including health
[02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:42.080]   care personnel and media are exempt good luck enforcing that i don't remember such a curfew
[02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:46.560]   being issued for black lives matter or antifa when they were running around burning down historic
[02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:51.920]   churches attacking innocent people assaulting police officers here we see trump supporters
[02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:58.560]   not engaged in in meaningless pointless impotent violence but rather simply pushing past the police
[02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:03.200]   and into the capitol building to make themselves known uh trump supporters chase way outnumbered
[02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:07.840]   capitol police and throw objects at them this is julio rosas uh but again here you see trump
[02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:12.000]   supporters actually putting their bodies in front of the police and just saying hey just keep back
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:15.920]   enough we're not going to attack you we're not going to hurt you you are not our enemy uh
[02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:22.880]   yeah you don't see this type of behavior from the leftist when they get going you see a lot of
[02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:28.000]   attacks of innocent people you see a lot of uh burning things down you see destruction of valuable
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:33.120]   sometimes irreplaceable uh property i've seen no statues torn down here i've seen no egregious
[02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:39.120]   violence i've seen no violence really at all except for the occasional punch thrown or mace
[02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:49.040]   can being sprayed uh but we see which is more effective here guns drawn as we see uh at least
[02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:56.800]   three capitol city security officers level their pistols over the furniture that's been piled in
[02:07:56.800 --> 02:08:02.880]   the in the uh congressional chamber what is it okay this is a protester now standing in the
[02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:09.680]   speaker's position i believe that's in the senate i believe that's the senate building if i'm not
[02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:15.920]   mistaken for the senate chamber rather we see protesters reports of shot shots fired on capitol
[02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:21.360]   hill as more and more police rush from throughout the capitol city to the capitol building in an
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:29.680]   attempt to uh mitigate or or somehow prevent or do something to stand up against the onrush of
[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:37.360]   trump loyalists patriots and america firsters as we move towards the capitol building into
[02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:46.080]   the capitol building and then into the senate and congressional chamber absolutely incredible mayor
[02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:53.600]   bowser issuing his city-wide curfew that i if i had to guess he will be ignored uh confirming
[02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:58.000]   other reports speaker pelosi has requested the national guard troops to clear and secure the
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:02.640]   capitol via request from the capitol police board a dc government official tells me troops

[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:11.120]   from somebody who continuously showed support and encouragement for the riots that ravaged our
[02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:17.680]   country for months and months uh a different story when it's on her front yard that's hypocrisy if
[02:10:17.680 --> 02:10:25.360]   i've ever seen it here we're seeing actually video of this armed standoff having been uh reported by
[02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:31.440]   breaking 911 and mep fuller armed standoff inside the house chamber as chamber members are piling

[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:44.960]   have been fired and the security of the capitol building has been utterly devastated and decimated
[02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:49.840]   and the rioter well yeah i guess we'll call them rioters why the hell not right the rioters the
[02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:55.680]   protesters the patriots the americans the trump supporters the revolutionaries have taken the

[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:30.080]   the speaker has been removed from the chambers we have on the line now owen schroyer who is
[02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:35.280]   live on the scene in washington dc owen what is going on there do you have any information for us
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:40.640]   sure in fact we're probably going to have to be going back and forth with whatever intel we have
[02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:45.120]   because obviously out in the streets um you know we're just getting whatever we can out here and
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:50.080]   and i've just been pulled off the streets for the first time uh speaking speaking of owen i just got
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:56.080]   this uh information uh not confirmed but we have reports of a woman shot in the arm attempting to
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:12:02.160]   breach the chamber so we have guns drawn inside the chamber uh furniture piled against the door
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:08.560]   the uh security is firing out through the door and has apparently shot a woman in the arm we have at
[02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:13.200]   least one gunshot wound the pentagon has denied the request to deploy the national guard to the
[02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:19.440]   u.s capital that's of literally two seconds ago from aurora intel and we're also receiving reports
[02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:24.480]   of the georgia capital has been stormed as well the state capital in georgia has now been stormed
[02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:29.760]   so this is just incredible and i'm sorry for interrupting you owen but uh i mean this is just
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:34.320]   unbelievable stuff that we're seeing here again i'm sorry uh back to you what is it like on the
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:38.800]   ground there where are you are you near the capital and uh just what's going on where you are
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:43.920]   no i'm glad you broke in with intel in fact we've been the capital we were there for about the last
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:49.760]   hour maybe hour and a half it's tough to say for sure um but we now the capital we're trying to get
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:56.800]   uh a set up here that so we can get on air with you guys on on on us exit i was on two there i
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:13:03.760]   would say at 50 000 people surrounding the capital right now uh maybe even a hundred it looks like
[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:15.040]   people around the street here and um yeah apparently so so i'll be back all right uh all right that's
[02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:19.680]   that's owen schroyer there they're on the scene in washington dc attempting to get a secure
[02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:24.240]   lines we can actually hear from them uninterrupted again the just sheer number of people is
[02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:29.760]   overwhelming the cell systems and we're having difficulty even getting in contact with people
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:34.640]   there but they're getting set up and will uh soon be able to give us live updates of what it's like
[02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:39.280]   on the street but again we actually have a better view from them because we're not relying on just
[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:44.240]   what we can see in here we're actually getting it from a thousand different directions at once
[02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:49.520]   i repeat the defense department has just denied a request by dc officials to deploy the national
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:55.840]   guard to the u.s capital they have denied that request uh this is oh my god this is amazing all
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:14:01.920]   right so now we're seeing video of the protesters they seem to have commandeered a window washing
[02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:08.080]   platform and are raising themselves up to the second floor to perhaps breach the windows there
[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:14.000]   trump flags waving american flags waving shots have been fired we have reports of one woman shot
[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:21.440]   from a protester a female protester has been shot by the capital security presumably who is inside
[02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:26.480]   the uh house chamber their furniture piled up against the door there were protesters trying
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:31.840]   to get through that door shots were fired through the window of that door and seemingly struck a
[02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:37.760]   protester these are the unconfirmed reports that we're receiving from less than a minute ago and
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:44.160]   we'll continue to bring you updates as we get them folks this is the revolution and it's only going to
[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:50.240]   be televised on infowars.com i'm receiving updates from all sorts of info warriors through twitter
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:55.200]   and we're also simply grabbing whatever we can from everybody who's there including including
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:15:01.680]   elijah shafer julia julio rosas now we see heavily armed with assault rifles military style rifles
[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:07.840]   body armor this is the capital police seemingly moving in towards the protesters i don't know if
[02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:14.320]   we can expect more violence or if things will perhaps come to a head soon but yes there are
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:20.160]   tens of thousands of trump supporters who have yet to enter the capital who have yet to attempt to
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:27.120]   breach the capital walls a massive american flag hanging outside of the capital uh scaling the
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:33.360]   walls using a window cleaning platform and again to me the most amazing images as of yet are the
[02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:40.480]   furniture piled against the interior door inside the chamber with at least three guards leveling
[02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:47.920]   their uh standard issue pistols through that door and apparently the report is shots have been fired

[02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:27.680]   using a window washing platform to raise themselves up to the second level and attempt to break
[02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:34.400]   through windows there this is absolutely unprecedented goings-on at the u.s capital
[02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:40.640]   in washington dc we see their images of protesters lying on the ground with their hands splayed as
[02:17:40.640 --> 02:17:47.440]   uh standing over them with military rifles leveled are the the backup the uh well armored and well
[02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:55.920]   armed battalions of capital city police here you can see being uh you know laying down on the
[02:17:55.920 --> 02:18:00.480]   ground these protesters it's peaceful protests folks mostly peaceful uh trump supporters are
[02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:05.680]   just an idea i think you're aware of that uh the senate is expected to go back into a uh session
[02:18:05.680 --> 02:18:11.040]   in an alternative session shortly according to c-span that's the update by ian miles
[02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:16.560]   chong i believe we have owen schreuer back on the line we had we got cut off there earlier but uh i
[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:22.080]   think he can hear me owen are you there oh he's gonna get okay yeah so the uh the cellular networks
[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:28.400]   are uh in constant flux here as we continue to try to get reports from the ground the videos that
[02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:33.360]   are being uploaded are coming intermittently and we're bringing to those to you just the minute
[02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:39.040]   that we get them the second that we get them in many cases uh trump uh trump has uh tweeted out
[02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:47.440]   his disappointment in uh pence people uh posting these videos of the protesters absolutely
[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:55.040]   surrounding and uh slamming okay uh bloody woman on a stretcher right now on msnbc that was three
[02:18:55.040 --> 02:19:01.280]   minutes ago by maria you know you know hosa uh omg bloody woman on a stretcher right now so that
[02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:05.520]   must have been the woman who was shot the tweet from president trump please support our capital
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:09.840]   police and law enforcement here we're seeing video from once again inside the senate chamber you can
[02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:19.280]   see the members of the uh of the congress crouching behind walls hiding after as as gunshots ring out
[02:19:19.280 --> 02:19:24.880]   although what has been reported so far is the only shots that have been fired are from the capital
[02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:31.920]   city police out through the door of this chamber uh at the protesters who are attempting to get in
[02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:37.600]   here we see the bloody stretcher and a woman oh my gosh being uh oh my god but putting pressure
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:41.920]   on a wound it looked like we heard reports she was shot in the arm that looked like she was shot in
[02:19:41.920 --> 02:19:48.720]   the chest perhaps the collarbone but absolutely covered in blood as she's rushed away from the
[02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:54.960]   capital this may be the first casualty of the second american revolution this woman who is
[02:19:54.960 --> 02:20:00.640]   presumably oh my god and they're pumping her wow they're pumping her uh chest that means she was
[02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:08.000]   most likely unresponsive uh that woman may have died or at least sustained a critical energy
[02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:13.840]   owen uh owen's on the line now owen you're there we're seeing images live images of protesters
[02:20:13.840 --> 02:20:19.040]   inside the uh the congressional chamber and we just saw a very disturbing video of a young woman
[02:20:19.040 --> 02:20:25.200]   being wheeled away blood all over her chest her chest being palpitated by the first uh responders
[02:20:25.200 --> 02:20:32.320]   there it did not look good for her uh you you're on you're on the air now owen so uh we've gotten
[02:20:32.320 --> 02:20:36.080]   to a location now where i should be able to talk without getting interrupted um let me just walk
[02:20:36.080 --> 02:20:41.120]   through my day real quick and we can kind of give you an update uh or we can go back and forth with
[02:20:41.120 --> 02:20:47.600]   the latest update i'm on air right now so basically okay in this historic the city is going under
[02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:51.440]   martial law we caught anti-provocateurs with witnesses and the footage that first started
[02:20:51.440 --> 02:20:58.240]   the storming but then triggered all this so so alex is going to be breaking that down momentarily
[02:20:58.240 --> 02:21:03.520]   um we got to the trump rally today about 8 a.m there were probably about half a million people
[02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:09.600]   there that we could see the entire washington monument was filled i mean unlike anything we've
[02:21:09.600 --> 02:21:13.920]   ever seen half a million i would say conservatively trump spoke the whole crowd was there till about
[02:21:13.920 --> 02:21:19.440]   2 p.m we then marched to the capital where it looks like maybe half the crowd has gathered
[02:21:19.440 --> 02:21:22.720]   at least a hundred thousand people here have surrounded the capital more than 100 they have
[02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:31.360]   maybe even on the war cut all ads on the war room they'll commercial free uh as soon as they can
[02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:35.920]   commercial free on all shows commercial free i'm telling you folks this is historic they declared
[02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:41.840]   basically martial law they're sending in national guard it's absolutely insane all because antifa
[02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:47.120]   the minute trump announced he was going to come speak antifa uh dressed up like patriot with
[02:21:47.120 --> 02:21:52.000]   knee pads and and arm pads uh attacked the police to stage the triggered event so they
[02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:57.120]   said so they triggered this stampede we have the witnesses we have the police and right now i mean
[02:21:57.120 --> 02:22:01.840]   again we're on one side of the capital so we can't see both sides but on this side alone there's
[02:22:01.840 --> 02:22:06.240]   probably about a hundred thousand people they've taken the capital grounds they've surrounded the
[02:22:06.240 --> 02:22:13.360]   building itself they're on the actual building uh structure also as you know that they've gotten in
[02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:19.280]   so uh this is all developing right now but at least a million people in dc many of which are
[02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:24.080]   surrounding the capital uh many of which are just still roaming the streets and it's going to be
[02:22:24.080 --> 02:22:28.960]   interesting to see what happens tonight at 6 p.m uh but i mean this is crazy i mean we literally
[02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:35.200]   own these streets right now there is not a block uh within the white house or the capital uh or
[02:22:35.200 --> 02:22:39.920]   the supreme court or anything where there's not at least ten thousand a hundred thousand a quarter
[02:22:39.920 --> 02:22:45.680]   million truck supporters and so you know it's it's so it's so tough to really put this into
[02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:50.480]   perspective because here's the deal we're not violent revolutionaries but they've taken our
[02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:55.680]   country our country is occupied and and you can debate all day long what the appropriate response
[02:22:55.680 --> 02:23:00.880]   is the point is we finally have a response and we haven't had any fight in our congress we haven't
[02:23:00.880 --> 02:23:04.880]   had any fight in our legislatures and so this is what's going to happen is we the people are going
[02:23:04.880 --> 02:23:09.840]   to have to fight again we did not come here as violent revolutionaries uh but the history is
[02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:14.720]   definitely being made right now i don't know if today is the turning point uh that will change
[02:23:14.720 --> 02:23:20.800]   the course of american history or if this is just the the nexus of the beginning of we the people
[02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:24.160]   taking our country back but i mean honestly it's hard it's hard to really put into words it's hard
[02:23:24.160 --> 02:23:32.320]   to really uh vocalize what exactly i'm witnessing i mean the images will maybe do it justice but uh
[02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:36.000]   we're gonna have to see what comes of this and again we've just been on the ground leading
[02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:41.600]   rallies leading marches doing speeches and it eventually all culminated here at the capital
[02:23:41.600 --> 02:23:46.400]   which again i'd say at least a hundred thousand people i'm looking at on one side of the capital
[02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:52.160]   and this isn't even the side they breached this is the side of the inauguration um stage that they
[02:23:52.160 --> 02:23:57.040]   have set up which has also been taken by trump supporters they've unveiled massive american
[02:23:57.040 --> 02:24:01.040]   flags they've put up trump flags on the scaffolding i mean everywhere you look the whole
[02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:06.160]   building surrounded by american flags trump flags people chanting usa quite frankly it was it gave
[02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:12.640]   me chills and goosebumps to be seeing this um but there's no there's definitely gonna be tours out
[02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:18.080]   here there's no doubt that the democrats here at least locally are going to be using this
[02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:21.200]   too
[02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:29.120]   okay uh yes we are skipping all breaks we're um you're you're breaking up just a little bit there
[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:34.000]   maybe we can re-secure that connection we can come back to you just let me give you a quick update
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:40.080]   here uh hundreds of protesters now inside the u.s capital building at least one woman has been shot
[02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:45.120]   she may be the first casualty of the second american revolution a woman looked like she
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:51.760]   was in at least a critical condition a first responder ems worker uh palpitating her heart
[02:24:51.760 --> 02:24:57.600]   as she was rushed off the scene on a gurney blood pouring out from a wound that looked to be in her
[02:24:57.600 --> 02:25:02.480]   chest perhaps her collarbone all the reports say she was shot in the arm the report is that this
[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:09.280]   was a bullet fired through the door of the chamber uh the congressional chamber the furniture piled
[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:16.480]   up there as protesters tried to breach we have many videos many images of people inside senate
[02:25:16.480 --> 02:25:23.040]   offices apparently baked alaska is inside one of the office a popular youtube streamer live streamer
[02:25:23.040 --> 02:25:31.520]   the crowds continue to grow a curfew has been issued for 6 p.m by the mayor of dc nancy pelosi
[02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:35.680]   has requested the national guard come in to clear out the capital but that request has been denied
[02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:42.560]   by the pentagon protesters roaming the rooms of the u.s capital on live stream with complete
[02:25:42.560 --> 02:25:49.280]   abandoned complete access to any information they require because this happened so fast that
[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:55.920]   the senators and congressmen were not able to actually do anything to my god i'm seeing this
[02:25:55.920 --> 02:26:01.600]   image again of this woman i mean the blood is everywhere i think that woman's dead i honestly
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:10.160]   think uh this woman has been uh severely injured if not uh if not killed this is um this is serious
[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:14.720]   folks president trump in a tweet says i'm asking for everybody at the u.s capital to remain peaceful
[02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:20.400]   no violence this is following a woman having been shot we have people inside the capital in the
[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:27.040]   marble staircases uh climbing the walls from within uh waving trump flags standing at the
[02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:33.520]   speaker's position in the senate and congressional chambers at least one person shot that's the woman
[02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:39.600]   that we saw on screen hundreds of protesters now within the capital people are responding to this
[02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:46.480]   in almost predictable ways you have people such as eric erickson uh yeah eric erickson saying shoot
[02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:51.040]   the protesters waive the rules impeach waive the rules convict waive the rules deny the ability to
[02:26:51.040 --> 02:26:55.840]   run for election again which of course was their plan anyway and all along here we're seeing images
[02:26:55.840 --> 02:27:01.920]   of the security officers firing are we so we're not doing breaks anymore i can ignore that that
[02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:10.720]   break clock are we still alive i so as far as i know we're still alive okay all right yeah we're
[02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:17.600]   skipping all breaks uh all day today this is a historic moment and we need to be live uh without
[02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:23.520]   the interruptions that are pre-programmed by our radio station affiliates so we'll keep going
[02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:28.800]   through any and all breaks and i'll continue to be here until we get uh set up with a a a secure
[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:32.960]   connection to the info wars team that's on the ground there in washington dc including alex
[02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:37.520]   jones and owen schroyer and as soon as we get that up and running uh they will take over and let us
[02:27:37.520 --> 02:27:42.720]   know exactly what's going on again we're just getting updates from all around so eric erickson
[02:27:42.720 --> 02:27:50.480]   uh a blue check mark on twitter uh advocating to simply shoot all of the protesters to waive the
[02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:54.640]   rules impeach waive the rules convict waive the rules deny the ability to run for election
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:28:00.960]   ever again uh which of course this is this is a reaction right they they riot for an entire year
[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:06.480]   they burn down entire american cities they murder over 30 people they shoot down trump protesters in
[02:28:06.480 --> 02:28:12.560]   cold blood but if you dare to simply put up your hand in protest to them uh then you're an evil
[02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:19.280]   nazi on the other hand if you start to protest if you start to uh gather in mass and uh and break
[02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:24.400]   down doors and and uh storm the capitol building you deserve to be shot you deserve to be murdered
[02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:30.640]   your entire uh political uh party and everyone involved it deserve to be barred forever from
[02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:35.760]   uh holding office this is what's at stake ladies and gentlemen this is what is being decided right
[02:28:35.760 --> 02:28:40.480]   now don't trump says i am asking for everyone at the u.s capital to remain peaceful no violence
[02:28:40.480 --> 02:28:44.400]   remember we are the party of law and order respect the law and our great men and women in blue the
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:51.200]   problem with that mr president is that we have we have for four years and we've been abused for four
[02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:56.480]   years we've tried to remain peaceful we've tried to remain law-abiding for the last years our
[02:28:56.480 --> 02:29:01.200]   cities were burned around us as we were locked inside of our own homes as criminals were given
[02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:06.720]   complete abandon as time after time antifa and black lives matter protesters were arrested in
[02:29:06.720 --> 02:29:12.320]   violent acts and then released the next day to perform them again time and time again we have
[02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:16.880]   tried to be the party of law and order we have tried to respect the status quo the laws the
[02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:22.400]   system as we wish to uphold it instead we've been disappointed we've been betrayed we've been
[02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:29.600]   stabbed in the back literally many times now perhaps the patience has run out and we're seeing
[02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:34.560]   images here on the screen of this woman who was shot who was taken out on the on the um
[02:29:36.320 --> 02:29:42.480]   gurney that we saw earlier she is not looking responsive we see people there attempting to put
[02:29:42.480 --> 02:29:47.600]   pressure on the wound we saw the aftermath of this as she's wheeled away from the store
[02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:53.600]   my god this is brutal folks this is incredibly brutal wow this is absolutely incredible
[02:29:53.600 --> 02:30:03.040]   but uh again once again what you're seeing from the left is they want uh total authoritarianism
[02:30:03.040 --> 02:30:10.160]   they want a complete shutdown of any and all ability for trump supporters or conservatives to
[02:30:10.160 --> 02:30:16.400]   stand up for ourselves so far the only violence that has been committed this day has been against
[02:30:16.400 --> 02:30:21.360]   the protesters who are there we just saw a protester shot i would not be surprised if we
[02:30:21.360 --> 02:30:25.680]   soon receive reports that she's passed away that was a brutal shot it looked like right to her
[02:30:25.680 --> 02:30:31.280]   chest these were people trying to get in through the door of the uh chamber and apparently she was
[02:30:31.280 --> 02:30:35.200]   shot by a security guard that's the reports that we're hearing on the ground these are
[02:30:35.200 --> 02:30:40.800]   unconfirmed but this is uh all the information that we have so far once again you have to
[02:30:40.800 --> 02:30:46.160]   think about the fact that for six months and for years before that how many times did we see
[02:30:46.160 --> 02:30:52.000]   leftists try to tear down the doors of the capitol building we saw leftists uh during the cavanaugh
[02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:57.920]   hearings attempting to tear down the door uh can you imagine if one of these protesters unarmed
[02:30:57.920 --> 02:31:05.200]   peaceful attempting to simply open a door is shot at point blank in cold blood by one of these
[02:31:05.200 --> 02:31:11.360]   one of these uh capitol police this is egregious this is unacceptable tear gas now being deployed
[02:31:11.360 --> 02:31:18.320]   within the capitol uh this is shocking and astonishing and again uh the only violence i have
[02:31:18.320 --> 02:31:24.080]   seen perpetrated so far beyond uh you know one or two you know punches in in return for a punch
[02:31:24.080 --> 02:31:28.800]   thrown by a police officer the only violence i have seen has been the cold-blooded point blank
[02:31:28.800 --> 02:31:35.600]   shooting of a woman in the chest by the capitol city or the capitol police rather this is uh
[02:31:35.600 --> 02:31:40.720]   this is disturbing and of course the leftists are saying just shoot them all you know if you dare
[02:31:40.720 --> 02:31:44.880]   protest against us we we can protest we can burn your city down for a year and a half we can just
[02:31:44.880 --> 02:31:50.240]   you know for a year for four years we can just um obstruct everything we can destroy everything
[02:31:50.240 --> 02:31:56.320]   we can murder people in cold blood vice magazine will uh give us a a good 30-minute documentary in
[02:31:56.320 --> 02:32:02.480]   order to air our views to smear the dead man to to uh call him racist and a bigot and a nazi in
[02:32:02.480 --> 02:32:08.080]   order to justify his death that's the reaction you get if you are a protester on the left you get a
[02:32:08.080 --> 02:32:12.320]   complete carte blanche even if you're caught in the act even if you resist arresting if you attack
[02:32:12.320 --> 02:32:17.840]   police officers you'll be taking to the prosecutor who takes their orders from the soros funded
[02:32:17.840 --> 02:32:23.920]   organizations to let you go immediately punish you not at all and allow you the very next day to go
[02:32:23.920 --> 02:32:34.000]   out and destroy and uh uh cavort once again so tables have turned if you're a republican if you
[02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:40.960]   are a conservative if you actually protest in an effective and aggressive way in the exact same way
[02:32:40.960 --> 02:32:46.960]   that has been protested for the last year you apparently deserve to be shot down in cold blood
[02:32:46.960 --> 02:32:51.600]   even though you're unarmed even though you're peaceful even though as we've heard time and
[02:32:51.600 --> 02:32:59.920]   time again hey things can be replaced stuff can be replaced well you'll be shot down cold dead
[02:32:59.920 --> 02:33:08.080]   your blood spilling on the floor of the capital this is this is absolutely incredible absolutely
[02:33:08.080 --> 02:33:14.080]   unbelievable hundreds of protesters now in the u.s capital tear gas uh being spread looks like
[02:33:14.080 --> 02:33:18.640]   we're getting uh more updates protesters now on the highest floor on the house floor rifling
[02:33:18.640 --> 02:33:23.360]   through lawmakers desks it'll be interesting to see what information comes from this people are
[02:33:23.360 --> 02:33:29.520]   already investigating the uh things that are being found on uh stuff like the nancy plosie's computer
[02:33:29.520 --> 02:33:36.560]   and of course on the right people on twitter are now reposting uh tweets from people like
[02:33:36.560 --> 02:33:41.360]   alexander ocasio cortez who says the whole point of protesting is make people uncomfortable
[02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:46.160]   activists take that discomfort with the status quo and advocate for concrete policy changes
[02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:51.440]   popular support often starts small and grows to folks who complain protest demands make others
[02:33:51.440 --> 02:33:59.280]   uncomfortable that's the point and the double standard rises again if the democrats didn't
[02:33:59.280 --> 02:34:04.560]   have a double standard they wouldn't have standards at all milo yanopoulos writes out on twitter quote
[02:34:04.560 --> 02:34:09.760]   all i need now is alex jones and the speaker's chair alex jones owen schroyer and the info wars
[02:34:09.760 --> 02:34:14.880]   crew is not currently inside the capital i don't believe they're even on the capital grounds i
[02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:20.720]   think they're in a secure building uh just a little ways away overlooking all of this chaos
[02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:27.840]   going on and attempting and trying and uh striving to set up a more secure uh phone line and video
[02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:32.720]   line so we can be taking their feed and hearing from them on the ground what exactly is happening
[02:34:32.720 --> 02:34:38.400]   once again eric erickson on twitter has been deleted it's got 715 likes he says shoot the
[02:34:38.400 --> 02:34:42.160]   protesters waive the rules impeach waive the rules convict waive the rules deny the ability
[02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:47.280]   to run for election again of course this is standard for uh the democrats they have said
[02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:52.000]   time and time again as this election has wound down the moment donald trump is out of office
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:55.920]   they'll be prosecuting him they'll be prosecuting anybody that supported him they'll be sending to
[02:34:55.920 --> 02:35:00.080]   jail anybody that dared to support the president of the united states that in and of itself is
[02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:06.960]   a greater threat to the american system and the republic as fragile as it is that uh sentiment
[02:35:06.960 --> 02:35:13.920]   the those uh expressions are more of a threat to our system and our country than this protest
[02:35:13.920 --> 02:35:19.280]   ever could be once the system itself starts persecuting people politically starts prosecuting
[02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:25.280]   people for their political views starts punishing people with the full uh weight and force of the
[02:35:25.280 --> 02:35:30.800]   state behind them because of their differing political views that is the death of the republic
[02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:35.840]   from ted cruz he says quote those storming the capital need to stop now the constitution protects
[02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:39.920]   peaceful protest but violence from the left or right is always wrong i've not seen any violence
[02:35:39.920 --> 02:35:44.800]   i've not seen any violence from the protesters yet am i wrong can the crew tell me have i seen
[02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:49.120]   have i seen violence from the protesters they've broken a few windows they've torn down some
[02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:54.400]   barriers i've seen one or two throw uh you know throw a punch here or there but they usually get
[02:35:54.400 --> 02:35:58.960]   you know that i think all those people have been sort of arrested and and pulled away i've seen no
[02:35:58.960 --> 02:36:05.120]   violence on behalf of the protesters only being committed against them so ted cruz can tell the
[02:36:05.120 --> 02:36:11.280]   police officers don't shoot peaceful protesters how about the police don't gun down innocent
[02:36:11.280 --> 02:36:16.240]   protesters who are unarmed because that's what's happening right now that's what's just happened
[02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:23.680]   and we've not received an update yet of that young woman who was shot point blank through a window by
[02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:30.800]   the capital city police that's what we're seeing now and we're seeing uh rifle armed terrified
[02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:36.880]   looking police officers capital officers uh keeping people down like hostages there in the uh
[02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:45.920]   in or near the rotunda but yes leftists advocating to shoot the protesters while being presented with
[02:36:45.920 --> 02:36:53.200]   their own sentiments from earlier this year saying that uh protests are good you're supposed to be
[02:36:53.200 --> 02:36:59.200]   uncomfortable you're supposed to be uncomfortable crowd continues to increase in size uh we'll
[02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:06.720]   continue to bring you updates videos images and information as we get it my god
[02:37:06.720 --> 02:37:12.720]   the images of this gunshot victim are truly harrowing
[02:37:12.720 --> 02:37:19.840]   hard drives says from nicole arbor hard drives from offices in the capital have been taken by
[02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:25.520]   citizens this is bananas so it looks like the people who have been able to successfully break
[02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:33.120]   into uh senate offices and congressional offices uh did so with such swiftness that the protesters
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:39.520]   there were or the i'm sorry the uh the staffers and congressmen and senators there were unable
[02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:45.600]   to even grab their information grab their papers or even shut down their computers so now unlocked
[02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:51.280]   and open to anybody those computers are being accessed by the protesters who themselves are
[02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:56.720]   gathering information downloading hard drives or stealing the hard drives outright uh we
[02:37:56.720 --> 02:38:02.000]   can expect to see the fallout from this continue on for a very long time but i remind you again
[02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:10.560]   after a year of complete chaos a year of protest a year of literally tens of thousands of violent
[02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:16.560]   riots with dozens of murders uh i mean just trillions of dollars worth of damage maybe
[02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:22.720]   not really but but many many billions of dollars worth of damage to american cities we have heard
[02:38:22.720 --> 02:38:28.720]   time and time again how valuable uh protests are how good protests are how antifa is only an idea
[02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:34.320]   how black lives matter is uh simply a set of beliefs that if you don't believe you're racist
[02:38:34.320 --> 02:38:39.760]   uh and we've watched silently because we always knew that the end of the day we had our vote we
[02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:44.640]   always knew that when it came right down to it the american system was powerful enough flexible
[02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:56.320]   enough good enough to maintain and we knew that if we just trusted and exerted our rights as
[02:38:56.320 --> 02:39:03.440]   members of a republican citizens of this democracy that we could regain our footing and get back on
[02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:09.760]   track well that vote has been stolen from us if you're wondering what is inspiring the overwhelming
[02:39:11.680 --> 02:39:16.640]   activity that we're seeing here at the capitol as trump supporters move into the capitol building
[02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:23.440]   and start to destroy things uh it's that that last release valve has been taken destroyed
[02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:31.120]   perverted and prevented from being accessed and used by the people who for so long have
[02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:36.000]   patiently stood by and watched their country literally burned around them now i haven't seen
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:40.720]   any of these protesters tear down statues i haven't seen any of these protesters commit
[02:39:40.720 --> 02:39:45.840]   violence i haven't seen any of them attack police in fact quite to the contrary i've seen police
[02:39:45.840 --> 02:39:51.920]   retreating with trump protesters standing in front of the police officers holding up their hands
[02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:58.160]   preventing other protesters from doing anything untoward this just in from disclosed.tv dc mayor
[02:39:58.160 --> 02:40:03.200]   bowser is asking again to deploy the national guard pentagon is considering it but concerned
[02:40:03.200 --> 02:40:11.760]   about uniformed troops in the capitol that would be a major major major step in the history of
[02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:18.480]   america to have the united states army occupy the capitol now nothing like this and as far as i'm
[02:40:18.480 --> 02:40:23.920]   know has ever occurred in the history of the united states this is a utterly unique situation
[02:40:23.920 --> 02:40:30.560]   an unprecedented situation that we are now uh watching live and of course if you are not watching
[02:40:30.560 --> 02:40:34.720]   infowars you may be getting your information from one of the mainstream sources in which case you
[02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:41.440]   are just now hearing that uh quote police draw guns inside u.s congress to protect
[02:40:41.440 --> 02:40:52.160]   to protect lawmakers okay the reality is guns were drawn a standoff ensued and an unarmed protester
[02:40:52.160 --> 02:40:58.400]   was shot in the chest and has now been evacuated and um from all appearances is in critical
[02:40:58.400 --> 02:41:03.360]   condition at least with her heart her chest being palpitated by the emergency responder
[02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:09.520]   as she's wheeled away on a gurney blood pouring forth from that wound this is the up-to-date
[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:15.680]   information one woman in critical condition thank god oh my god all right i thought she was dead i
[02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:20.640]   thought for sure this woman had died it's still touch and go obviously critical condition means
[02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:25.200]   anything could happen but this is the update from bno news on twitter one woman in critical
[02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:31.600]   condition after being shot in the chest at the u.s capital truly incredible truly incredible
[02:41:31.600 --> 02:41:36.720]   and we're seeing uh images of this event come across and once again
[02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:44.320]   just just imagine just imagine folks if this had been a leftist antifa black lives matter first of
[02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:49.760]   all the police would have backed down the police would have kneeled the police would have joined
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:57.600]   them no doubt on the behest of their corrupt crooked city government instead gunshots fired
[02:41:57.600 --> 02:42:06.480]   bullets shot at the peaceful protesters and one woman now in critical condition thank god we're
[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:12.400]   praying for her because i thought for sure from that image that she would not not make it woman
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:16.880]   who was trying to breach the doors inside the u.s capital was shot in the neck by the capital police
[02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:23.440]   she's since been brought out of the building on a stretcher this is this is absolutely absurd and
[02:42:23.440 --> 02:42:29.920]   we're hearing uh we're hearing calls from a republican you know it's almost it i don't know
[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:33.520]   i don't want to say anything i shouldn't say
[02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:41.440]   this just in georgia and kansas capital buildings have been stormed by protesters so now it sounds
[02:42:41.440 --> 02:42:49.360]   like the state capital buildings have been stormed by protesters it's amazing isn't it that again
[02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:55.440]   after after six months eight months an entire year of protest by antifa and black lives matter you
[02:42:55.440 --> 02:43:00.640]   ask a democratic lawmaker about it he says i never even heard of such a thing what is this defund the
[02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:05.200]   police i've never heard anybody say defund the police that's what bernie sanders said jerry
[02:43:05.200 --> 02:43:13.280]   nadler antifa is just an idea right it's conspiracy theory uh meanwhile we are about two hours into
[02:43:13.280 --> 02:43:19.280]   this insanity going on in the capital building and already republican lawmakers are condemning
[02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:24.000]   their own supporters uh telling them uh that they're at fault that they're the ones being
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:29.280]   violent while the only violence that i've seen perpetrated thus far have been uh flash bangs
[02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:35.440]   fired into the trump crowds and a woman shot in the chest and neck area who is now in critical
[02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:40.000]   condition after being fired upon point blank while she was trying to open a door into the
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:51.360]   congressional chamber it's an illustration isn't it it's an example of the two different approaches
[02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:57.360]   now again for a year the patriots have put up with the chaos they've put up with the destruction
[02:43:57.360 --> 02:44:04.000]   they have held their tongue kept their guns holstered kept their weapons at their side and
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:12.160]   allowed the literal i mean communist agitators funded paid for by foreigners trained by chinese
[02:44:12.160 --> 02:44:18.080]   communists and they've been allowed to perpetrate the most egregious violence all over the united
[02:44:18.080 --> 02:44:26.000]   states for a year and it seems like finally after having been robbed of their last release that that
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:32.080]   final chance of we can we can at least vote we at least have our vote you know all that got robbed
[02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:38.480]   from them and was in the process of being robbed from them today when all of this chaos broke out
[02:44:38.480 --> 02:44:45.200]   i'm serious i don't think there's i i have not seen violence from the from the protester i've
[02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:50.880]   seen them tear down barriers i've seen them break windows i've seen them uh push and shove at cops
[02:44:50.880 --> 02:44:56.320]   i've seen one guy throw a punch at a cop after the cop punched him i've seen mace being sprayed in
[02:44:56.320 --> 02:45:03.200]   both directions i've seen a mere percentage of a percentage of the violence we saw on nearly a
[02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:10.320]   daily basis starting in about march of last year and continuing all the way through the summer with
[02:45:10.320 --> 02:45:16.560]   tens of thousands of riots a large portion of which were not just violent but deadly at the
[02:45:16.560 --> 02:45:22.640]   hands of protesters who were never caught never punished and never even addressed or acknowledged
[02:45:22.640 --> 02:45:29.440]   by their uh constituent or by their um representatives uh again from disclose.tv urgent
[02:45:29.440 --> 02:45:34.320]   pull that back up virginia national guard and 200 state troopers are now being deployed
[02:45:34.320 --> 02:45:44.160]   to washington dc so while the pentagon has denied uh the dc mayor and nancy pelosi they've denied
[02:45:44.160 --> 02:45:51.760]   sending sending soldiers in to the capital it looks like the virginia national guard and 200
[02:45:51.760 --> 02:45:56.800]   state troopers are now being deployed to washington dc we've heard reports of georgia and kansas state
[02:45:56.800 --> 02:46:04.000]   houses both having been occupied both having been attacked and we're seeing uh live view on fox news
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:10.480]   and other places of heavily armed heavily armored police officers moving towards the u.s capital
[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:15.200]   and again that woman who was shot is in critical condition as of now
[02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:23.040]   uh and again and now we're also seeing from tim dunn on twitter the tunnels that were used to
[02:46:23.040 --> 02:46:28.400]   to bring uh bring up so it looks like
[02:46:28.400 --> 02:46:33.680]   this is i mean this is just mind-blowing folks i'm
[02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:43.760]   i'm having trouble uh getting a good grip on exactly what's going on uh from bno news
[02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:48.960]   large number of police and swat vehicles are moving towards washington dc right now and we
[02:46:48.960 --> 02:46:53.680]   actually have a video of the police officer shooting the woman inside the united states
[02:46:53.680 --> 02:46:59.200]   capitol building and again just imagine folks if on the first day of black lives matter rallies
[02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:05.840]   uh but black lives matter riots uh one of their protesters who was unarmed a woman was shot at
[02:47:05.840 --> 02:47:11.360]   point-blank range in the chest by a police officer would we ever hear the end of it would this not be
[02:47:11.360 --> 02:47:17.280]   an example of the tyranny of the fascism that they love to uh to portray
[02:47:17.280 --> 02:47:24.800]   uh the violence and destruction taking place the u.s capital must stop this is a tweet by mike pence
[02:47:24.800 --> 02:47:29.200]   the violence and destruction taking place the u.s capital must stop and it must stop now anybody
[02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:34.640]   involved must respect law enforcement officers and immediately leave the building you continue to say
[02:47:34.640 --> 02:47:38.320]   peaceful protest is the right of every american but this attack on our capital will not be tolerated
[02:47:38.320 --> 02:47:42.240]   and those involved will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law wouldn't that be a
[02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:50.160]   change wouldn't that be something new protesters prosecuted how many how many hundreds of thousands
[02:47:50.160 --> 02:47:57.200]   of people have been arrested in places like antifa places like portland washington minnesota
[02:47:58.480 --> 02:48:05.200]   michigan have been taken to the prosecutor released that very day to be out on the street
[02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:09.760]   committing the same crime being arrested once again the very next day time and time again this
[02:48:09.760 --> 02:48:16.480]   has occurred but i wouldn't doubt it i wouldn't put it past them you know that the way our country
[02:48:16.480 --> 02:48:22.640]   is right now uh the full force and weight of every single system every single
[02:48:24.480 --> 02:48:30.160]   law enforcement agency will be brought to bear and they will attempt to make an example out
[02:48:30.160 --> 02:48:41.760]   of anybody and everybody involved in this where we go from here is hard to tell hard to say
[02:48:41.760 --> 02:48:50.560]   trump encouraging his supporters to stay peaceful which they have they absolutely have once again no
[02:48:50.560 --> 02:48:55.200]   i didn't see any people attacking police i didn't see them throwing rocks or bricks at the police
[02:48:55.200 --> 02:49:05.600]   as we saw in places like chicago throughout the summer who's this uh representative david trone
[02:49:05.600 --> 02:49:10.720]   says i'm safe we've been evacuated let me be clear we will not be stopped by this lawless
[02:49:10.720 --> 02:49:16.000]   intimidation that's how you got here isn't it lawless intimidation isn't that what brought
[02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:21.760]   us to this point the lawlessness and intimidation being exerted by black lives matter and antifa
[02:49:21.760 --> 02:49:30.080]   for the better part of a year and once again i mean if this were the democrats doing it
[02:49:30.080 --> 02:49:36.000]   we would see exactly the same images that we see here today and the democrats would be out there
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:41.520]   saying trump supporters don't exist that's a fiction of your imagination that's what jerry
[02:49:41.520 --> 02:49:48.320]   nadler said he said antifa is a fiction a part of your imagination it's a fiction it's a lie
[02:49:48.320 --> 02:49:52.240]   it doesn't exist it's a right-wing conspiracy theory that's what he said about antifa
[02:49:52.240 --> 02:49:58.400]   months and months after the riots had begun and continued on a daily basis he said it doesn't
[02:49:58.400 --> 02:50:05.200]   exist kayla mckinney at president trump's directive the national guard okay all right
[02:50:05.200 --> 02:50:12.400]   so he's so president trump is sending the national guard now he never sent it for uh
[02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:19.200]   for antifa okay we we have owen schroyer now overlooking the u.s capital massive crowds over
[02:50:19.200 --> 02:50:26.160]   his shoulder check one two three four doing doing a quick audio check let me know whenever um he can
[02:50:26.160 --> 02:50:34.000]   hear me oh and can you read me say we now go all right um all right folks so we have owen schroyer
[02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:38.400]   and the info wars crew in washington dc overlooking the u.s capital we now go live to owen schroyer in
[02:50:38.400 --> 02:50:46.080]   washington dc ladies and gentlemen owen schroyer here for infowars.com and i'm really not quite
[02:50:46.080 --> 02:50:52.000]   sure how to tell you the history that we're witnessing here today other than for you to just
[02:50:52.000 --> 02:51:00.720]   see the actual images of millions of patriots rallying for trump today chanting usa
[02:51:01.600 --> 02:51:10.960]   is a capitol building where they have now breached the grounds and are now surrounding the capitol
[02:51:10.960 --> 02:51:19.040]   building now these are the types of events that go down in history this january 6th 2021 will no
[02:51:19.040 --> 02:51:26.240]   doubt go down in american history now what will that history say about today we're here fighting
[02:51:26.240 --> 02:51:31.680]   for president trump we're here fighting for our elections we're here fighting for the republic we
[02:51:31.680 --> 02:51:37.840]   want to use this day as we're seeing all the traitors in the republican party and congress
[02:51:37.840 --> 02:51:44.160]   everywhere stab us in the back we all know trump won we all know they stole it we saw the hundreds
[02:51:44.160 --> 02:51:49.200]   of thousands of illegal ballots that gave biden the victory in georgia come in at 6 a.m they counted
[02:51:49.200 --> 02:51:55.040]   for weeks we saw the hundred thousand ballots that came in for biden and michigan at 6 a.m that gave
[02:51:55.040 --> 02:52:05.280]   him we all saw it happen and they want to tell us oh no that didn't happen that's not happening
[02:52:05.280 --> 02:52:09.680]   kind of like when they go on air when there's burning buildings behind them and they say this
[02:52:09.680 --> 02:52:16.080]   is a peaceful protest but there's burning buildings behind them holding a break a peaceful protest
[02:52:16.080 --> 02:52:21.360]   nothing has been burned but then people apparently have been shot inside the capitol now we're still
[02:52:21.360 --> 02:52:26.720]   getting intel on what that is we've gotten to a safe location because it was just too crazy out
[02:52:26.720 --> 02:52:30.800]   there on the streets but and that was capital police that's probably false that's the left
[02:52:30.800 --> 02:52:35.040]   probably we're getting later in the intel is probably false what's false the shooting inside
[02:52:35.040 --> 02:52:39.280]   well there was i mean a woman came out in a gurney bleeding so i don't know who we don't know who did
[02:52:39.280 --> 02:52:45.520]   it when is this crazy point is again this is just a there's video now right now and pence is now
[02:52:45.520 --> 02:52:54.000]   having taken place so now pence has also betrayed president donald trump so trump is now a man on a
[02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:59.280]   on a mountain by himself and he has we the people fighting for him by the way the police just
[02:52:59.280 --> 02:53:04.400]   confirmed one woman was shot in the leg inside the capitol so we've had one person shot but again
[02:53:04.400 --> 02:53:11.680]   they breached the building and they got in while they were voting to either certify or debate
[02:53:11.680 --> 02:53:17.040]   whether they were going to certify it for biden or not and that's when it happened and so all
[02:53:17.040 --> 02:53:23.280]   hell is broken loose they have in the underground tunnels which we told you they were going to do
[02:53:23.280 --> 02:53:29.920]   yesterday and in fact they did do yesterday so look we want freedom we want liberty and when the
[02:53:29.920 --> 02:53:34.880]   government fears the people we have that now we don't want them to feel that there's a violent
[02:53:34.880 --> 02:53:40.880]   revolution coming but we want them to know that we the people are not going to stand for their
[02:53:40.880 --> 02:53:46.560]   treason and we the people are not going to stand for rigged elections now people can debate all day
[02:53:46.560 --> 02:53:51.520]   long what is the appropriate response we're continuing live through the breaks on infowars.com
[02:53:51.520 --> 02:53:56.080]   and band.video the live streams are continuing the radio stations may be going to break now but
[02:53:56.080 --> 02:54:00.320]   we'll be right back on the other side but stay with us if you're online because the the streams
[02:54:00.320 --> 02:54:04.880]   will continue and we go back to owen schroyer live outside of the capitol our elections has been
[02:54:04.880 --> 02:54:08.880]   completely violated what is the appropriate response well you can debate it all day long
[02:54:08.880 --> 02:54:16.080]   but the response we've seen today is millions of trump supporters rallying in dc listening to trump
[02:54:16.080 --> 02:54:21.760]   speak listening to others speak they were here yesterday all night as well and then today coming
[02:54:21.760 --> 02:54:29.680]   to the capitol and breaching the grounds now we have eyewitness testimony that says it looks like
[02:54:29.680 --> 02:54:35.760]   there were agent provocateurs who actually started the breaching procedure but because there were so
[02:54:35.760 --> 02:54:41.520]   many trump supporters around it was just like a flood of momentum oh somebody's coming in oh the
[02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:47.360]   barrier went down oh now we're just all going in led to at least one person getting shot and then
[02:54:47.360 --> 02:54:54.000]   just all hell breaking loose and last night there was already some tensions between the local police
[02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:59.520]   here and trump supporters because they initiated a curfew said you can't go to bars you can't go
[02:54:59.520 --> 02:55:03.760]   to restaurants so people are just out in the streets because they got nowhere else to go so
[02:55:03.760 --> 02:55:08.160]   they're out in the streets and then the police come in and try to shut them down rush them
[02:55:08.160 --> 02:55:13.600]   uh bull rush them arrest people and so that caused tension last night and then i think that spilled
[02:55:13.600 --> 02:55:21.840]   over to today we are capturing this history for you right now live on info wars and it's really
[02:55:21.840 --> 02:55:27.280]   just an incredible thing because i don't think these people are going anywhere this crowd has
[02:55:27.280 --> 02:55:34.480]   been holding now for at least an hour and they have the building completely surrounded
[02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:43.200]   now it is cold out here and it looks uh to me now like people are gathering around different
[02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:49.040]   entrances of the capital so it looks like what where the crowd used to be completely dispersed
[02:55:49.040 --> 02:55:56.480]   around it it now looks like there is a a funnel if you will a surge of people going into a side
[02:55:56.480 --> 02:56:01.440]   entrance and then a surge of people over here but as you can see the inauguration stage that has
[02:56:01.440 --> 02:56:08.400]   been set up has been completely overwhelmed so they have hung obviously what is it looks like
[02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:13.600]   about a hundred foot long american flag you've got trump flags everywhere american flags everywhere
[02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:18.560]   so we just want to send a peaceful message to the globalist to the chinese who own half of our
[02:56:18.560 --> 02:56:23.920]   congress and mike pence and the congress members hey we voted for donald trump he won the election
[02:56:23.920 --> 02:56:29.760]   you know it you better do the right thing and not certify the fake vote for biden because then it
[02:56:29.760 --> 02:56:35.760]   gets even worse hey it's one thing to have to deal with the theft of our election it's another thing
[02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:43.040]   to now have to realize we have a compromised foreign agent criminal who is wanted in the
[02:56:43.040 --> 02:56:49.840]   country of ukraine he is a wanted felon in the country of ukraine doing business deals in china
[02:56:49.840 --> 02:56:56.320]   his son in russia kazakhstan iran all over the globe so that he can sell us out so we don't want
[02:56:56.320 --> 02:57:01.680]   to get to that point again you can debate what is the proper response to two billion dollars in
[02:57:01.680 --> 02:57:05.840]   property damage with no with no law and then them stealing our election you can debate that this is
[02:57:05.840 --> 02:57:11.120]   the response we see but now the debate will become if truly pence is going to stab us in the back
[02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:14.960]   with the rest of congress now the debate is what do you do with a foreign agent as president of the
[02:57:14.960 --> 02:57:20.320]   united states that is an illegitimate unelected president but a stolen president and quite frankly
[02:57:20.320 --> 02:57:24.560]   folks i got to be honest here we're we've been on the streets all day
[02:57:24.560 --> 02:57:28.480]   the energy the
[02:57:28.480 --> 02:57:35.680]   it's hard to even know what to say or how to handle it and i know that alex who has been
[02:57:35.680 --> 02:57:41.680]   fighting this battle for so long and is witnessing this right now is is just almost at a loss of

[03:00:09.280 --> 03:00:15.600]   without interruption uh here's some breaking update updated news msnbc says the person shot
[03:00:15.600 --> 03:00:20.000]   on the capitol grounds is in critical condition five others including a law enforcement officer
[03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:26.560]   has have also been sent to a hospital uh the entire national guard in washington dc has been
[03:00:26.560 --> 03:00:33.200]   activated and from this is uh unconfirmed but it does say that protesters are engaging u.s
[03:00:33.200 --> 03:00:40.720]   secret service hand to hand combat again that's uh unconfirmed i'm not sure if that's a troll post
[03:00:40.720 --> 03:00:45.360]   or not mike pence has said the violence and destruction taking place the u.s capital must
[03:00:45.360 --> 03:00:49.680]   stop and it must stop now anybody involved must respect law enforcement officers and immediately
[03:00:49.680 --> 03:00:53.600]   leave the building this attack on our capital will not be tolerated and those involved will
[03:00:53.600 --> 03:01:03.920]   be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law absolutely incredible stuff hakim jeffrey says
[03:01:03.920 --> 03:01:09.520]   members plan to return and certify the electoral college members from both parties applaud but
[03:01:09.520 --> 03:01:15.280]   first they're still clearing the capital the media is calling the riot an insurrection
[03:01:15.280 --> 03:01:21.200]   and wouldn't it be wouldn't it be amazing to be a democrat wouldn't it be wouldn't it just be
[03:01:21.200 --> 03:01:24.960]   absolutely amazing if we were the mainstream media and we could sit here with all of this going on
[03:01:24.960 --> 03:01:29.280]   with people being shot with the capitol building broken into and we could just sit here and go
[03:01:29.280 --> 03:01:36.240]   well a small peaceful gathering of trump supporters occurred earlier today it was nothing
[03:01:36.240 --> 03:01:41.840]   really to see no one was hurt nothing really happened it was just regular americans expressing
[03:01:41.840 --> 03:01:47.680]   their right to protest and if you dare to oppose this and all of this talk of sitting in the
[03:01:47.680 --> 03:01:54.800]   national guard is clear evidence of tyranny and you know the the fascism that is slowly
[03:01:54.800 --> 03:02:00.640]   gripping our entire country and if you don't support this you are a racist and you want
[03:02:00.640 --> 03:02:07.200]   innocent people to be murdered by police we don't have the luxury of being able to ignore reality
[03:02:07.200 --> 03:02:12.320]   here we have to face it as it comes and so we're bringing you everything that we hear and see
[03:02:12.320 --> 03:02:18.960]   up to date the capitol the washington state capitol building in olympia washington also
[03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:24.800]   has a large crowd gathered outside of it with people saying quote we go down swinging and again
[03:02:24.800 --> 03:02:31.040]   the media after having been after having ignored a year's worth of rioting after having downplayed
[03:02:31.040 --> 03:02:36.320]   the violence the destruction the chaos that has been wrought on the american people for the better
[03:02:36.320 --> 03:02:42.720]   part of a year as decent americans were shut down locked down imprisoned in their own homes and
[03:02:42.720 --> 03:02:50.160]   forced to shut down their businesses for the sake of covid 19 and we were told the riots were not
[03:02:50.160 --> 03:02:58.000]   riots they were protests the destruction wasn't destruction it was speech and now after less than
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:04.400]   two hours of pushback from the right they're calling it an insurrection they're calling in
[03:03:04.400 --> 03:03:10.720]   the national guard they're advocating for every one of the protesters to be shot and they are
[03:03:10.720 --> 03:03:17.680]   freaking out completely i guess this was to be expected now again we've had a bird's eye view
[03:03:17.680 --> 03:03:24.960]   of all of this and now they're saying from zero hedge explosive device found at rnc dnc has been
[03:03:24.960 --> 03:03:33.360]   evacuated not sure where those exactly are if those are parts of the capitol building
[03:03:34.160 --> 03:03:42.000]   or if those are nearby buildings at least one woman has been shot she's fighting for her life
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:48.640]   in critical condition the video of that firing which we played on air not too long ago has been
[03:03:48.640 --> 03:03:53.600]   expunged from twitter twitter has hidden the account that posted it and the video itself
[03:03:53.600 --> 03:03:59.200]   has been taken down they're saying a reporter is having a panic attack because they're locked in
[03:03:59.200 --> 03:04:03.680]   the capital without any police protection and we hear and feel rumblings underneath us this is
[03:04:03.680 --> 03:04:07.520]   scary folks especially after being labeled the enemy for some four years
[03:04:07.520 --> 03:04:19.600]   i'll keep bringing you updates here this is infowars.com we're going uh commercial free
[03:04:19.600 --> 03:04:25.760]   completely uh by the way more people uh posting and tagging me in these types of posts remember
[03:04:25.760 --> 03:04:30.720]   when dims were allowed to protest inside the rotunda then one of them cornered jeff flake
[03:04:30.720 --> 03:04:37.120]   in an elevator yeah good times right say our vote our turn hashtag our vote our turn
[03:04:37.120 --> 03:04:51.200]   more protesters breaking into congressional offices senatorial offices and uh destroying or
[03:04:51.200 --> 03:04:58.640]   taking information and hard drives it looked like this um this video of the woman being shot

[03:05:40.720 --> 03:05:45.360]   mean this is this is just history in the making and quite frankly this lady getting shot is only
[03:05:45.360 --> 03:05:50.160]   going to make people even matter because uh it just is going to show the double standard again
[03:05:50.160 --> 03:05:54.960]   it's just going to show the double standard again that we have to witness so much here
[03:05:55.760 --> 03:06:02.800]   which is uh two billion dollars in property damage this summer no arrests no one held accountable
[03:06:02.800 --> 03:06:07.840]   oh but we go into the capital and the lady gets shot nobody'll even know her name but if somebody
[03:06:07.840 --> 03:06:13.840]   overdoses on fentanyl in milwaukee it causes two billion dollars in property damage uh we're still
[03:06:13.840 --> 03:06:17.440]   getting intel people are still outside the capital this is a developing story in a developing
[03:06:17.440 --> 03:06:23.680]   situation a turning point perhaps in u.s history and in world history and i'm not even sure
[03:06:25.280 --> 03:06:31.200]   how to even describe this i think the images and the story of there's a communist chinese takeover
[03:06:31.200 --> 03:06:34.160]   with the new world order of the country they're trying to steal the election they're trying to
[03:06:34.160 --> 03:06:37.680]   bankrupt the nation they're telling us the country shouldn't even exist they're telling us the word
[03:06:37.680 --> 03:06:42.800]   mother and father can't exist this is a communist takeover and everybody knows it and south america
[03:06:42.800 --> 03:06:47.280]   is starting to push back and gg ping and everybody else needs to know you're the one starting all
[03:06:47.280 --> 03:06:51.440]   this not us and you're the ones that are gonna pay just like hitler and just like all the rest
[03:06:51.440 --> 03:06:56.480]   of scumbags and you know this is this is what happens this is the result this is like if you
[03:06:56.480 --> 03:07:00.800]   don't if you don't deal with a cancer and you have cancer and you don't deal with it until it's too
[03:07:00.800 --> 03:07:05.920]   late they basically only have one shot and that's just a chemotherapy radiate the hell out of you
[03:07:05.920 --> 03:07:10.400]   and then hope you can survive that's what we're going through we've had a cancer in this country
[03:07:10.400 --> 03:07:16.640]   for decades we've had a communist chinese takeover for decades we've been occupied by tyrants for
[03:07:16.640 --> 03:07:21.280]   decades and we've been ignoring it and that's why we've had a background at the show the last week
[03:07:21.280 --> 03:07:25.040]   of the capital of red clouds going over it we should put that background up because
[03:07:25.040 --> 03:07:29.760]   there it is folks a foreign takeover of our country that was so powerful successful because
[03:07:29.760 --> 03:07:34.160]   it was freer than other nations the freedom is what makes us have money and be prosperous and
[03:07:34.160 --> 03:07:38.160]   now it's draining out it's like all the blue cities and all the blue states so more of our
[03:07:38.160 --> 03:07:41.520]   crew got here we got more of our better equipment we're going to reconnoiter some of that before we
[03:07:41.520 --> 03:07:45.280]   start the fourth hour we're going to hand this back over to harrison smith but we'll be back

[03:10:40.560 --> 03:10:48.560]   which is a guess a change of fate here and uh so we'll be starting the war room in just
[03:10:48.560 --> 03:10:52.960]   10 seconds on info wars.com and band.video commercial free the war room continues the
[03:10:52.960 --> 03:11:03.680]   next three hours we'll continue to cover this stay with us
[03:11:21.600 --> 03:11:31.120]   info wars the most banned network in the world january 8 2021 is a very important date
[03:11:31.120 --> 03:11:41.600]   that's this coming friday january 8 2021 that's when our great sponsor my patriot supply of high
[03:11:41.600 --> 03:11:47.200]   quality herbal food has to go up on their prices because there's so much inflation and there's so
[03:11:47.200 --> 03:11:53.760]   much massive demand coming in as the public and the world wakes up to the fact that the globalist
[03:11:53.760 --> 03:11:58.480]   are using the lockdown to bankrupt people and destroy small businesses and bring us to our
[03:11:58.480 --> 03:12:06.320]   knees the public is now learning just how dystopic this long-term lockdown is and the fact that it's
[03:12:06.320 --> 03:12:12.720]   premeditated to bring the united states to its knees people are digging in food sales are
[03:12:12.720 --> 03:12:18.240]   exploding now you remember back 10 months ago there were five six month waits on storable food but
[03:12:18.240 --> 03:12:24.080]   our sponsor could get it to you in a couple months everybody did get their food well they have all
[03:12:24.080 --> 03:12:30.320]   the food now on hand packaged high quality ready to go to you a lot of other suppliers don't now
[03:12:30.320 --> 03:12:37.520]   that's important but not as important as this on the eighth they will then be forced to go up on
[03:12:37.520 --> 03:12:42.080]   their prices because they're unable to basically pay their bills at the current rate because food
[03:12:42.080 --> 03:12:48.320]   prices are going up so much in the future they've already gone up so much so you need to get your
[03:12:48.320 --> 03:12:54.800]   orders in by the eighth to get it shipped out to you within days of receipt of it and to lock in
[03:12:54.800 --> 03:13:01.200]   those lower prices and to save up to 850 in savings on their different packages because
[03:13:01.200 --> 03:13:06.320]   they're not just keeping the prices at their regular price we're doing one final big sale
[03:13:06.320 --> 03:13:12.320]   on one month four months six month year supplies and they've got so many other great items air
[03:13:12.320 --> 03:13:17.760]   water filtration they've got it all this is where i get my storable food they've been my sponsor for
[03:13:17.760 --> 03:13:24.960]   13 years the company's 14 years old after being in business for 10 years they became the biggest
[03:13:24.960 --> 03:13:29.760]   storable food company in the united states because of the quality because the customer service and
[03:13:29.760 --> 03:13:34.960]   because of the great packaging and portability so again as the public figures out that we're going
[03:13:34.960 --> 03:13:39.040]   into the great reset new world order you're going to see runs on food you're going to see

[03:13:44.960 --> 03:13:49.760]   to you very very quickly before the sheep will really figure it out and i believe you'll see

[03:15:08.960 --> 03:15:15.440]   four years ago re-elected him by an even bigger landslide rejecting and repudiating and discrediting
[03:15:15.440 --> 03:15:20.480]   the globalist that's why they had to overturn the chessboard that's why they had to engage in naked
[03:15:20.480 --> 03:15:26.000]   election fraud in front of everyone and as long as we never accept the fraudulent results as long
[03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:30.720]   as we don't let them gaslight us into submission as long as we point out this is a foreign globalist
[03:15:30.720 --> 03:15:35.760]   takeover of our country and that all the depression and all of the collapse that's coming is because
[03:15:35.760 --> 03:15:41.360]   of the new world order this will end up fully destroying them in the future if we don't submit
[03:15:41.360 --> 03:15:45.760]   if we submit they'll normalize the communism they'll normalize putting us into a depression
[03:15:45.760 --> 03:15:50.640]   they'll normalize breaking up our families taking our guns we can't let that happen and
[03:15:50.640 --> 03:15:56.000]   info wars is more important than ever so please paul reveres i salute you for your past actions
[03:15:56.000 --> 03:16:01.920]   keep spreading ban.video and info wars.com and come to the big dc marches on the 5th and 6th
[03:16:01.920 --> 03:16:11.520]   of january i'll see you there god bless the year 2021 is now here and world government and the new
[03:16:11.520 --> 03:16:16.240]   world order and their post-human agenda is out on the open it's now more important than ever that
[03:16:16.240 --> 03:16:20.720]   all of you realize that the fact that you're awake and you're informed and you're involved means
[03:16:20.720 --> 03:16:25.200]   you're the brain trust you're the tip of the spear that understands what's really going on in the
[03:16:25.200 --> 03:16:29.200]   planet and the globalists fear you that's why they've been trying to censor you and silence
[03:16:29.200 --> 03:16:35.680]   you and silence organizations like info wars where those of us understand what's happening are able
[03:16:35.680 --> 03:16:41.440]   to congregate share information and move against their operation their plan is very diabolical and
[03:16:41.440 --> 03:16:47.120]   over the top evil but if people are simply informed about it and resist it you can and will and really
[03:16:47.120 --> 03:16:52.480]   must be defeated now in that fight we fund ourselves by selling products direct to the
[03:16:52.480 --> 03:16:58.080]   public because as you know the globalists shut down and boycott all of their opposition but
[03:16:58.080 --> 03:17:03.280]   we've built the model of resistance that can take them down because you are supporting us and buying
[03:17:03.280 --> 03:17:08.880]   products directly from info wars now i've got a lot of complaints thousands of them saying in the
[03:17:08.880 --> 03:17:14.720]   last eight months or so a lot of our favorite products are unavailable why that's because of
[03:17:14.720 --> 03:17:20.320]   the covid lockdown not covid many of the proprietary patented ingredients in our products were
